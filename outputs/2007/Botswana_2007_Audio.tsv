21467	23068	Hello, hello, and welcome.
23108	24029	Thank you very much.
24049	34256	Now, as you know, the producers on this show like to give us challenges, specifically where they give us a very small amount of money and tell us to buy a used car.
34597	39640	Then they set unbelievably hard tasks to do to see which one of us got the best deal.
39900	40080	Yeah.
40541	44043	This week, for a Top Gear special, they came up with a real humdinger.
44423	50408	They gave each of us 1,500 quid and told us to go to Africa and buy a car.
51108	52829	Yeah, there were just two conditions.
53149	57990	It mustn't be four-wheel drive, and it mustn't be built in any way to go off-road.
63772	68174	The meeting point was the border post between Zimbabwe and Botswana.
68974	71735	And, for once, I was the first to arrive.
75069	77350	Now, as you'd expect, I've done this properly.
77450	92156	What I've got is a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 230e, a car that Africa absolutely adores, because it's comfortable, it's rugged, it's dependable, and frankly, if the other two have brought anything other than one of these along, they're idiots.
93937	95497	The first idiot arrived.
95557	99119	Can you open the door?
99299	100179	The handle's broken.
100860	102060	It is a Lancia Beta.
102220	102440	Coupé, 1981.
104969	108392	The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of Botswana.
108652	111054	It's done 29,000 miles.
112455	113076	One owner, is it?
113096	115158	It's the little old lady.
115878	117520	And boy, had she ragged it.
118060	119101	Yeah, that's normal, isn't it?
120022	120642	That fizzing?
121483	123505	That's... Yeah.
124145	125406	What's the piece of cardboard for?
125446	126667	Is that for mopping up moisture?
127088	129970	No, that's because the battery... Oh, it shorts on the bonnet?
129990	131111	Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
131631	132212	You've done well.
133840	134240	So, now what?
134260	134801	Do you want a lift?
135762	139525	We left the Lancia to cool down, because Hammond was arriving.
140526	141407	– What the hell is that?
141427	142007	– I don't know.
143268	144389	Could it be a Moskvitch?
144409	146371	– It's an Opel.
146391	147172	– Opel?
147192	149033	And on the front it says Cadet.
149053	149133	Yeah!
149354	155119	What the hell have you done, man?
155419	156960	It's an Opel Cadet from 1963.
159966	162207	So that's the same age as... That's the same age as Nick.
162267	164208	Yes, but it's much better Nick than you.
164608	164788	It was £1,200.
164948	168009	I had much change with which to buy many beans.
168249	169509	How much more simple can you get?
169569	173671	It's got two moving parts and it's been here for 44 years.
173931	174911	I love the speedo.
175031	177212	I do like a horizontal speedo.
177352	177952	I really do.
178132	178792	Where's the engine?
178932	179652	It's there.
179672	180313	Hang on.
180953	181873	It's tiny.
181893	183034	Do you want to know about the power?
183434	183814	Yes, I do.
184844	185204	Forty.
185404	187005	Forty horsepower.
187045	190446	Well, they did do a sport version with 48, but I didn't want anything too lairy.
194307	195287	You've both been idiots.
195788	196128	No.
196328	199289	Brilliantly interesting, brilliantly stylish, but stupid.
199409	201029	Why is mine stupid?
201249	201910	Where is yours?
204230	206531	Anansi, you have been a bit thick.
208032	211433	With the cars at the start line, it was time for our challenge.
216266	221890	The people of Surrey think they need four-wheel drive cars because they live up a lane which sometimes has leaves on it.
222270	235659	You will now attempt to prove them wrong by driving your two-wheel drive cars from here on Botswana's eastern border with Zimbabwe, which is there, 1,000 miles to its western border with Namibia.
236540	239402	That's right across the spine of Africa.
245433	246234	I'm confident.
247474	247935	I wasn't.
250376	253338	We hadn't even started and the Lancia was playing up.
262364	264045	James chose not to wait.
265806	274151	He may be mechanically confident, but he has just turned right, which is symbolic, which is where I should point out the BBC is not allowed.
276889	277810	Sorry, sorry.
277930	278690	I'm going now.
281613	285535	The Lancia wheezed into life and Hammond and I set off in pursuit.
292180	303829	If you think of the cars that this inspired, it was latterly built in Russia, where it became the Moskvich, which was rubbish.
304750	308273	And, of course, indirectly, the Vauxhall Astra.
308814	312457	Quite a lot of reasonably average cars owe themselves to this.
312477	324227	I don't know if you know, but Africa is really quite large, and when you're out in a very remote part, you need a car like this that can be mended with a brick and a piece of string.
325117	331388	What you have to remember is that three of the most rugged and successful rally cars ever made were Lancia's.
331989	335615	The Stratos, the 037 and the Delta Integrale.
336016	339001	Lancia know how to make a rally car.
340732	345897	Unfortunately, on the day my beauté coupé was made, they obviously forgot everything.
346598	351462	The gearbox is broken, the steering's broken, the window's broken.
351722	353424	In fact, we all had problems.
354145	358429	Everything works except this knob, which controls the blood.
358829	362791	I've got to have the windows open because there's quite a strong smell of petrol.
363291	365772	And that mirror over there, which is actually slightly stuck.
366352	370514	Hazard warning lights, the clock, the fan, the handbrake, all of the dials.
370855	373256	The brakes are terrible because they only work on that wheel.
373436	376317	They work very well on that wheel, but only on that wheel.
377117	378638	And that instrument's a bit wobbly.
378658	382560	Apart from that, everything that's actually important to the car works perfectly.
383560	386882	Apart from the handbrake, which I can pull like this as we go along.
388453	393758	Nevertheless, because we were on tarmac roads, we decided to give our cars a shakedown.
394258	395379	Building up speed now.
395799	397321	When it was made, this car had 116 horsepower.
397341	398662	Top speed, 115 miles an hour.
398682	399863	Here we go.
399903	401925	Going 100 kilometres an hour more.
410006	411267	Right, I'm going to overtake the truck.
411307	411687	Here I go.
412248	413769	He's pulled out of its slipstream.
414329	416851	Well, it's really coming up.
416871	416851	105.
418393	421055	Still truck.
421075	421055	105.
421515	422216	Still truck.
424838	422216	105.
424858	424958	3,000 revs, 3,500.
425078	425698	Pulls cleanly.
425798	426659	Hang on a minute.
426779	434505	It's got no fifth gear.
435126	438969	Somebody's put the knob from a five-gear model on it.
442162	445504	This is just the happiest car in the world.
445625	446465	As we call it, Oliver.
446485	448667	Not that we'd ever name a car on top of it.
448687	449567	I wish I hadn't said that.
451108	455892	It's now five past ten in the morning and it's starting to get quite hot.
456392	457293	I've got an idea.
464738	465219	Oh, yeah.
465619	466139	That's better.
466159	468241	Don't know what that is.
471647	474148	The horn!
474168	475689	Oliver, you've got a cold!
475749	476129	Listen!
480432	484734	We were having fun, but then we discovered we were travelling with Bill Oddie.
485202	485822	Why have you got a pen?
485922	487242	You tick them off when you've seen them.
487622	489263	Hornbill, southern yellowbill.
489763	490903	Take a look at your car.
491063	492363	It's massive!
492864	493604	Don't knock Oliver.
493624	494784	Don't knock my car.
494804	497925	That's a fine... He's a fine... What did you call it, then?
498425	500605	Oliver's a friend of mine and I thought you were talking about him.
500625	501845	He's given it a name.
501905	507567	He's given his car a name.
507607	509487	So far, the journey had been a doddle.
512659	515641	Then the tarmac just sort of stopped.
522066	522887	Oh, this is bad.
523347	527371	I can see from here just how hard the suspension on Jeremy's Lance is having to work.
527431	528331	It's just a blur.
531614	532955	Come on, Oliver, please!
533936	537098	The later you book a lift in the Mercedes, the more expensive it gets.
537158	538219	It's a bit like an airline.
538239	538800	Oh, God!
539180	539700	Oh!
542866	544447	Engine isn't working, it's cut out.
544807	545407	Oh, dear.
545787	548228	He's done literally one kilometre of this.
548469	549229	I know what's wrong with it.
549449	550209	The bonnet won't open.
550289	551510	Yeah, it's the bonnet catch.
551850	552391	Shut up!
553071	556032	Hammond was tetchy because he knew the price of failure.
556553	560855	Anyone whose car broke down would have to complete the journey in a beetle.
566187	568588	It is collectively our least favourite car in the world.
568929	569329	Oh, yes.
569469	570349	It is the punishment.
570930	571510	Please!
572871	573891	Oh, hang on, hang on!
575432	577974	Oh!
578054	579434	Come on, Oliver!
579815	580395	What did you say?
580415	583437	I said, I love you!
583617	584257	Oh, my God.
584657	585137	What now?
585518	588079	My car's on fire, but in a very specific place.
588659	589520	Wow, look at that.
589540	591021	It's a magnifying glass.
591041	592622	There's a laser beam coming through it.
594213	595594	Oh, his piece of cardboard's gone.
596254	597815	So it sets itself on fire?
598135	599596	If you don't have a piece of cardboard.
603157	605839	We drove deeper and deeper into the bush.
608940	609620	Lancia!
610121	610881	Yeah!
613342	614203	What is that?
617244	617944	Looks like the sea.
620646	623167	Eventually, the road disappeared altogether.
628442	630804	People of Surrey, I hope you're watching this.
631424	640610	We are... I'm driving a Lancia Beta Coupe, well, just in the middle of the... whatever you call this.
645954	649416	The good news was we'd successfully reached our campsite for the night.
649997	653139	The bad news came in the shape of another challenge.
653899	656361	Stretching before you is the macadicaddy.
659400	661401	These are the biggest salt flats in the world.
661421	665564	They're almost completely lifeless and as wide as Portugal.
666084	668306	No car has ever driven across them.
669136	671317	If you run out of water, you will die.
671337	675098	If your car breaks down and you can't be rescued, you will die.
675538	677739	If you run out of food, you will die.
678199	679980	It's like driving on a creme brulee.
680000	683801	There's a primeval ooze covered with a thin layer of salty crust.
684421	689283	If you have thin tyres, you will break through that crust, get stuck and you will die.
690043	695545	So it advises to fit fat tyres and remove as much weight as possible before setting off.
696903	697824	Well, how hard can it be?
698164	699085	Don't say that!
701306	703487	In camp, the weight-shedding began.
703508	704268	Ready?
707450	708191	That doesn't work.
713354	715235	Thanks awfully.
715275	716696	Feel how much this seat weighs.
718337	718938	Right, you work.
729640	731520	Fuel filler, I'll need that, maybe.
733281	737642	I'm going to take the hubcaps off, really, because they protect the hubs.
740202	741142	Can I point something out?
741262	741443	What?
741963	745043	Hammond's walking around his car muttering about how he needs all of it.
745063	747504	I know exactly what he's doing.
748024	749824	He's formed an emotional attachment, hasn't he?
749844	752605	It would be like saying to him, could you cut bits off your wife?
755097	755597	What are you doing?
756058	759340	I'm just going to take the radiator grill off on the basis that it's just an ornament.
759521	760061	Can I help you?
760441	760822	Please do.
761122	761862	Do you want your windows there?
761883	762783	No, no, no, no, they're fine.
762823	764585	No, really, I've worked that out.
764605	764865	Glasses?
764885	766566	This is the old glass.
766666	767547	Very thin glass.
768928	769389	Very thin.
772851	774032	God, they come off easily.
775554	775874	James?
776194	776494	Yes?
776654	777956	Using nothing but a hammer?
778256	778596	Yes.
779997	783740	Here's your beer.
784141	784481	Thank you, mate.
785674	786695	Have we lost enough weight now?
786975	789096	You haven't lost an ounce.
789116	791217	I've lost the spare wheel and something else.
791317	792038	Now look at mine.
792578	795580	I'm going to need some guide ropes to stop it floating away like a big balloon.
799722	800703	So tomorrow we die then?
801223	803424	No, I think it's like all these things, it's exaggerated.
803784	804245	We'll be fine.
804285	805625	Honestly, we're going to be fine.
805985	806566	We've done enough.
816957	825282	The next morning, on the edge of the salt pans, we thought we'd come under attack from a Bond villain, but it turned out to be the vice-president of Botswana.
828665	830486	That is a killer ride.
830606	834188	It's better than an official Rover 75 and a couple of policemen on motorbikes.
835269	837790	He was amazed to hear what was being planned.
838391	843014	I've just never known anybody to go across in a car.
843054	844575	This should be the first time, I think.
847034	847374	Oh, really?
847694	848835	Oh, really?
849075	849375	Yes.
850075	851055	That should be interesting.
851735	853216	You were smiling, you've just stopped.
855217	866280	Buoyed by the Vice President's optimism, we set off.
866360	869361	Nothing really prepares you for the sheer size of these.
874039	878222	I think, in a way, that is more frightening than the pole.
878242	882385	You can see the curvature of the earth.
883086	886248	As we ploughed on, the little Opel was going well.
886909	888150	Oliver is just skipping.
888590	888810	Boom!
889851	891452	This car was born to do this.
892793	897317	Sadly, though, despite the weight-shedding, my Lancia was not doing so well.
898231	904697	Judging by the way the tyres are kind of digging in as I'm driving along, I think a little bit more has to come out.
905397	909081	Still, as you can see from the tyres' grooves, I was doing better than the Merc.
912263	915306	I'm looking at James's rear wheel and he's digging in a long way.
916087	917488	I tried to help him along.
917508	921071	It's really helpful.
921852	923673	Well, he's always the beetle, James.
924374	925235	It's waiting for you.
928902	929583	What are you going to do?
929643	930344	It's sinking.
930424	932406	Honestly, we've done... How far is that, a mile?
932887	933287	It's there.
934288	936070	My Lancia waded in again.
936771	937432	Just a nudge.
938373	939034	That's a crash.
939174	939695	There's a thing.
940596	943880	Unfortunately, because it was an automatic, it was useless.
944440	946042	So we told Richard to try.
947043	948865	But he didn't want to hurt Oliver.
953888	957449	This was hopeless, so we had to rope in the camera crew.
957989	966811	Three, two, one... Because the ooze was so bad, we had to get even more drastic with the weight-shedding.
970192	971912	We toiled away for hours.
971932	976353	Well, two of us did.
977053	979614	And then, finally, we were ready.
982895	983775	Now, this is light.
984135	986976	Lancia, Beta, Coupe, Superleggera.
992979	994019	Not a modification.
996680	997620	This is excellent.
997740	1000021	Why don't all cars have no doors?
1001802	1005123	When I come to power, I'm going to make it a rule, because this is just better.
1011539	1020141	However, the Mercati Caddy was not going to let us off that lightly, and soon even our super lightweight cars started to struggle again.
1023122	1024842	Come on, just... Oh.
1025962	1026083	Oh.
1027183	1027543	Oh, yes.
1029223	1030484	No, this isn't good.
1033924	1034605	Oh, no.
1036105	1040146	Only the Opel remained trouble-free, which was bad news for me.
1042489	1043149	Yes!
1043410	1044210	Come on, man.
1044830	1047012	I'll go forward, Sam, and then we'll do it again.
1047032	1047292	Hang on.
1049273	1050074	How far is it?
1050594	1052855	Another five or six yards and we might be bobbing.
1053055	1054476	Oh, this is just horrible.
1058178	1059199	Keep going, keep going, keep going.
1059559	1060760	Keep going.
1061260	1061540	Yes!
1062421	1062641	Yes!
1064602	1065383	No.
1065863	1067024	James, don't go there.
1067044	1068044	You'll get stuck.
1068304	1068905	That's close.
1074807	1076088	Oh, for goodness' sake.
1076489	1078150	We have everybody, we'll push it off.
1078190	1079751	We need 100 men or more.
1082714	1083594	This is hopeless.
1086096	1089559	People of Surrey, you need four-wheel drive for this bit.
1091201	1095905	The gunk was so sticky, it had completely jammed the Lancia's rear wheels.
1097586	1098646	I can't describe it.
1099707	1100868	You just think it's just mud.
1100888	1101709	Do you know what it is?
1102730	1103010	Fish.
1103671	1106834	It's just rotted, prehistoric fish.
1107454	1109136	One, two, three.
1112399	1116202	Mercifully, the ground eventually hardened and we made good progress.
1116943	1120286	But then suddenly, the horizon was no longer flat.
1125066	1128107	Now, this is interesting, because we're now coming between what look like islands.
1129127	1129968	And I suppose they are.
1129988	1132068	This was a lake, so they would have been islands.
1132489	1133269	Amazing.
1133529	1142912	Absolutely amazing.
1147234	1147654	Where are we?
1149194	1150475	It's called Kubu Island.
1153036	1153616	We're about...
1155782	1157003	A third of the way across.
1157743	1159724	And you've been stuck about a thousand times.
1160044	1161445	That is smug.
1161925	1162825	A baobab tree.
1163525	1164586	Always wanted to see one of those.
1165546	1166447	Hammond, look at this.
1167707	1176451	Whoa!
1176851	1179852	It is just about the most astonishing place I've ever been.
1180673	1181373	Kind of witty there.
1189884	1192756	As the sun set, we headed for the campsite.
1211291	1217093	Day two on the salt pans, and we'd been told that today our problem would not be mud, but dust.
1217714	1221355	That meant James and I had to rethink our wardrobe solutions.
1227218	1230219	I've teamed my koi with a bin liner.
1230239	1231539	V-necked.
1231900	1234641	The last time I wore one of these, I'd seen a clash.
1235681	1237442	Frankly, I thought it was all a bit much.
1237502	1239523	I mean, how bad could this dust be?
1242589	1243069	My eyes!
1243809	1245510	Crikey, I can't even see Jezza already.
1248090	1253011	Oh, no, no, no, no.
1254971	1259672	Meanwhile, in my unmodified cadet... I'm going to adjust my quarter light a bit.
1259912	1261452	Just an inch.
1261532	1261972	That's better.
1262933	1269714	I can feel the heat there.
1270534	1270934	It's nice.
1272687	1273707	The kakai's come off.
1276908	1277308	Hello?
1278608	1282769	James and I made it through the dust with our lives considerably shortened.
1285170	1287190	I've got consumption and TB.
1288311	1290691	I've got every single 1920s disease.
1292491	1294392	And then Lord Smug piped up.
1294852	1299973	I had to close this at one point, just about that much, and then it pulls the air out and you just get fresh air through, it's nice.
1302093	1305135	You know what it's like when someone punches you really hard in the middle of the face?
1305215	1305855	I do, actually.
1306916	1309078	Then the surface got even worse.
1313981	1316803	It was like we were descending through the seven circles of hell.
1330114	1336137	I'd assumed it'd be the salt that would kill the notoriously rust-prone Lancia, but it was the rough going.
1336437	1340379	Even though it had now smoothed out again, the beater was in a bad way.
1341079	1341579	I've gone.
1341659	1342019	I've gone.
1342219	1342960	Are you conking out?
1343820	1345181	I've got no power, no drive.
1345201	1347282	Do you remember what the man said, Jeremy?
1347902	1349442	Breakdown and you... What is it?
1349563	1350343	Have a nice time?
1350363	1350823	No, die.
1350843	1359487	Well, that's loose.
1361089	1361709	That's hot.
1364971	1371155	It is a good job they cantered this engine over by 20 degrees, because that means it's more inaccessible than it would otherwise have been.
1371175	1372616	Oh, my God, look at this.
1383663	1385644	I've got to say, it has been nice, the piece.
1386124	1387305	You know, not having him around.
1390305	1395687	I've checked the alternator, the spark plugs, the HT leads and the distributor cap.
1396628	1397968	Poked around with the starter solenoid.
1397988	1400589	There's been faults with all of them, but it still isn't going.
1401710	1406132	I'm not sure which I favour most here, certain death or that beetle.
1408773	1410873	Come off!
1426454	1427715	I honestly believe it's had it.
1432939	1434260	It's my car on the crab.
1434981	1436943	No, it's tracking Troentruve.
1437183	1439144	He's worried about tracking, and look at it.
1440866	1445550	We knew that Jeremy would eventually catch us up, but what would he be driving?
1448552	1449913	I can see something in the mirrors.
1452415	1453456	Please let it be a beetle.
1454237	1455538	I do hope it's a beetle.
1456718	1458339	Please, please let it be a Beetle.
1458619	1459880	Please let it be a Beetle.
1461901	1465563	I'm back!
1466524	1468004	Oh, Jeremy, well done.
1468064	1469665	I'm disappointed... Sorry, delighted.
1470006	1471566	You're not in a Beetle!
1471787	1472887	Not a Beetle.
1473027	1476009	A fully functioning Lancia Beetle Coupe.
1476329	1479671	I just wanted the Beetle to pounce on you when you were straying behind.
1480592	1481352	I'm gutted.
1482573	1484033	Shall we just sandwich him, James?
1484314	1484574	No!
1498987	1504769	With our convoy back up to strength, we pressed on, apart from Jeremy being Bill Oddie occasionally.
1505050	1506990	This is where flamingos breed out here.
1507051	1507911	So that's breeding, is it?
1509560	1510220	It's a fossil.
1510621	1511261	It's not a fossil.
1511301	1512882	It only died about two years ago.
1512902	1514022	I was talking about you.
1514222	1515323	It's an ex-flamingo.
1515363	1516063	Hey, no, look.
1516304	1517124	What now?
1517864	1519445	I know what created this.
1520145	1520646	Ostrich.
1520866	1521666	Yes!
1522066	1523467	Its legs are miles apart.
1523507	1525088	That's exactly how it was walking.
1525888	1528470	You know, David Attenborough's about to retire.
1529290	1530751	Can I just say... What?
1531071	1534613	You look like a gay cowboy and you look like a gay terrorist.
1534733	1538195	No, you look like a terrorist with a broken windscreen wiper and your face is ridiculous.
1539244	1541345	Ern Hammond started to pick on my car.
1541365	1542426	Why haven't you turned it off?
1542686	1544207	It's gathering electricity.
1544287	1546589	So if you turn it off, the battery's not going to start it again.
1547089	1547990	Turn it off and start it then.
1548950	1550071	Turn it off and start it.
1551212	1553173	Let's have some beautiful silence.
1553574	1554074	Are you ready?
1554374	1554614	Yes.
1554634	1555615	Are you ready?
1555895	1556155	Yes.
1559457	1560058	Behold...
1564491	1566191	Why did you turn it off, you idiot?
1566211	1568432	Because he said it would... Good luck, mate.
1568452	1569512	Somebody will give you a jump start.
1569532	1570252	It'll be fine.
1570292	1571392	Don't go away.
1571472	1571913	Goodbye.
1575393	1578034	Annoyingly, Clarkson got the Lancia going again.
1579054	1581275	And then we came across some big birds.
1592608	1595069	And then we saw even more wildlife.
1595410	1596510	There's a cow.
1598071	1599312	Two cows, three cows.
1600793	1601013	Yes!
1602013	1602894	We've done it!
1603414	1605455	We had crossed the Macaddy Caddy.
1606576	1607457	Trees!
1608417	1608937	Life!
1609418	1612059	Mate, did you ever think that you'd do that?
1612499	1613500	I'm genuinely proud of him.
1614421	1614701	I am.
1616062	1621765	Really, I'm startled that this, that isn't a car anymore, whatever it is, has done it.
1622475	1626556	with its low-profile tyres and its low suspension that's broken.
1626817	1631938	Personally, I'm absolutely delighted because I think the Macaddy Caddy is one of the most unpleasant places I've ever been.
1632539	1634359	It's just a big bowl of dust.
1634379	1634979	Hello, mate.
1638241	1645463	Widow Twankey may have been glad to see the back of the salt pans, but despite this, they gave us a startling parting gift.
1649264	1650405	Wow, that is amazing.
1651246	1652987	That's the moon.
1653007	1653887	Yeah, that's the moon.
1653927	1658889	Because of the dust from the pans, you get... A moonrise in orange.
1659789	1660669	I've got goosebumps.
1662570	1664370	I know a Philip Larkin poem about the moon.
1664390	1665371	Would you like to hear it?
1665451	1665651	No.
1671093	1674294	As a new day dawned, our cars looked like wrecks.
1675594	1677755	But their ordeal was far from over.
1680399	1685583	Yes, we had crossed the salt pans, but we were still only a third of the way across Botswana.
1686184	1690167	And now we were about to enter the Kalahari.
1697873	1698554	Kalahari.
1700615	1704038	Everyone who comes to the Kalahari takes away a different memory of it.
1704298	1707841	Savagery, the simplicity, the vast heat.
1708102	1709663	Me, I think bumpiness.
1711494	1717521	It was as rough as hell, so we were glad when news came through that we were to stop at the next village.
1720063	1732697	Obviously, they recognise a truly classy car.
1736570	1739955	What could they possibly have in mind for us here?
1745123	1746365	It was another challenge.
1747106	1747547	Hello.
1748468	1748848	Here it is.
1750922	1753365	Your cars have travelled far and suffered much.
1753385	1753905	Yes, they have.
1754546	1761814	So we will now discover how much performance they've lost in a competition against the clock on a rally special stage.
1762255	1763877	Mine can't have lost any performance.
1763937	1764537	It never added any.
1765478	1767681	And I'm not going to ruin my Mercedes just for a few points.
1768822	1771465	You're right, you're not, because you're not driving it.
1771605	1772046	Well, who is?
1773231	1782523	Some say he's seen the Lion King 1,780 times, and that his second best friend is a Cape buffalo.
1783444	1789011	All we know is he's not the Stig, but he is the Stig's African cousin.
1801823	1803304	He's protecting the important bits.
1806286	1809188	Keen to get going, the three of us fired up our engines.
1809628	1811109	Well, when I say three.
1814351	1815612	It's absolutely dead.
1817033	1817913	Nothing is functioning.
1817933	1822536	There is no electrical... You two are not being helpful.
1822676	1822936	No.
1823497	1825058	What a stupid thing to say.
1826320	1827721	Interior light, headlight?
1827921	1828241	Nothing.
1828541	1831242	You don't know how to mend the ignition circuit on a 1981 Lancia Beetle?
1831282	1834784	No, it's... It was a long shot.
1835504	1838746	Annoyingly, a couple of the locals did know what to do.
1842667	1847650	And we drove to African Stig's rally stage, which was in a dried-up riverbed a few miles away.
1848810	1852872	With packed spectator stands, Oliver went first.
1853112	1854433	Three, two...
1855405	1855505	One.
1856146	1857467	Go!
1857948	1859069	Three miles an hour.
1859610	1861792	You know, when it was new, it had 40 horsepower.
1862172	1865375	If it's lost one a year, it's at minus four.
1865616	1866757	He's going round the first corner.
1866777	1867217	Hold on.
1870321	1871342	That was a power slide.
1873083	1873764	Look at that.
1873864	1877288	It does look... Ridiculous is the word you're looking for.
1879210	1883452	As the cadets struggle to get up the hill, the spectators left.
1883532	1884113	It is eminent.
1884173	1885853	Come on, joggle it, Stig's cousin.
1886814	1887674	He's enjoying that.
1888054	1890696	And one minute, 12 seconds.
1890776	1892877	I think that's a good benchmark for you to try and beat.
1894198	1896179	Next up was the Panzer Tank.
1896639	1900681	Most powerful, longest, best tyres... Longest?
1900961	1902422	Longest is good for rallying, is it?
1902582	1903402	It is on this, yeah.
1903682	1907064	So why doesn't... On loose surface rallies, don't they turn up with intercity trains?
1910871	1916333	That's the most ridiculous spectacle I've ever seen in my entire life, a Mercedes with no bonnet, no front wings, no doors.
1917574	1920315	In the hands of African Stig, though, it was flying.
1921275	1925397	That is the latest in a long line of pedigree, lightened Mercedes-Benz sports cars.
1925417	1927478	There's never been a Mercedes rally car.
1929579	1931199	Oh, yours is flying up the hill, mate.
1931219	1932100	Look at it go.
1932980	1935641	You wait till you see the Lancia wheel dance through there.
1935661	1937882	Oh, yeah.
1937942	1939223	Oh, it's out of control.
1941638	1942879	That's a big slide!
1948181	1949002	One minute six.
1949442	1951683	I'll just do my ancient... I hate you gloating.
1951743	1952643	No, let him do it.
1952983	1954644	It's like winning a semi-final.
1955245	1961507	Time now to put James in his place because the Lancia was on home turf with its rally pedigree.
1962088	1962768	Stratos, 037.
1963048	1963268	What?
1966590	1970511	That's not dust, it's on fire!
1970531	1973792	Can I turn it off?
1973832	1978594	Look at it all!
1979394	1980475	Stopwatch still running.
1980495	1982135	45 seconds.
1983155	1984216	We'll replace the seal.
1985756	1989277	And then, when it's cooled down a bit, he'll be able to do the lap.
1989317	1990298	He'll have difficulty, though.
1990418	1990798	He's off.
1993550	1994490	And maybe he started.
1994530	1995650	Maybe... Start the stopwatch.
1996050	1998551	I think he was in a hurry, so he decided not to take your car.
1999031	1999511	Hey, Jeremy.
1999751	1999991	What?
2000011	2000431	You're right, though.
2000451	2000891	Your engine.
2001351	2001912	It's canted.
2005752	2008373	Once again, the broken lance here was fixed.
2008773	2011753	And then Jeremy arrived with some woe for all of us.
2012794	2013014	What?
2015294	2015914	Forget some of it.
2015934	2017274	That's it.
2019895	2020895	Those are the fuel cans.
2021365	2027374	The problem was that Richard's car and mine ran on leaded fuel, which was incredibly hard to find.
2028356	2031461	And it was no use turning to the film crew for help.
2031821	2034145	Diesel, diesel, diesel and two-stroke.
2034185	2036669	Diesel... Guys, it's diesel and two-stroke.
2040000	2046542	The town of Maun was about 60 miles away, and with little fuel, we'd have to go there as the crow flies.
2047222	2049723	Now we really would see how they'd cope off-road.
2050123	2054864	We've got to try and keep the distance down to save what fuel we've got.
2055484	2061586	All we're looking for is a track indicating that other people have passed this way and they would be heading to a town.
2063786	2065247	That's how broken my car is.
2065347	2066327	I was doing that in park.
2072634	2074995	These thorns are incredible.
2075155	2075955	Oh, look at that.
2075975	2078076	They've got like cocktail sticks growing out of them.
2078496	2080017	Take cover.
2084358	2088000	Once again, the 44-year-old Opel absolutely shone.
2088620	2091421	Come on, little fella.
2092041	2092662	Yeah!
2093402	2098004	With our precious fuel burning away, we carved out the straightest path possible.
2100184	2101745	Guys, you know what we're driving through?
2102742	2103282	Plants.
2104083	2105204	No, this is a weed.
2105304	2107926	It grows locally and it's hallucinogenic.
2108446	2110127	What did you say?
2113530	2118153	If any car was going to get stuck, we would have put money on the Lance here, but no.
2118173	2119934	All right, mate?
2120275	2120655	Sorry.
2121976	2122696	All doesn't work.
2124278	2126319	Clearly, I'd have to get myself out.
2126799	2131543	I'm going to make a rudimentary temporary road for my back wheel.
2134511	2136832	Eventually, we found a smoother track.
2137672	2138133	Whoa!
2138673	2141834	And I did a detailed analysis of the Lancia's conditioning.
2142375	2142935	Sit-rep.
2144255	2146577	It's all broken.
2146597	2149038	As darkness fell, we found the road to Man.
2149338	2151859	But by this stage, even Oliver was suffering.
2152398	2153359	I can't use my lights.
2153719	2156422	Alternator's packed up all full of dirt and dust.
2156823	2160326	If I put the lights on, I can have the lights, but not the engine, because it all dies.
2160867	2172258	So I've actually got Jonathan, who brings all the cameras and does all that for us, in here with me, lighting me when I talk to you with the torch, which he then uses to light the road ahead when I'm not talking to you.
2180985	2182826	Finally, we rolled into Man.
2185548	2187630	Which year was it made?
2187970	2187630	1981.
2188290	2192253	It's just driven all the way from Zimbabwe to here without going on a road.
2192273	2193053	Like this?
2193273	2193493	Yeah.
2195755	2197316	Get out of the way of the pub.
2198197	2199217	I shall move it for you.
2199237	2201239	If you ask politely, I will move it.
2207163	2208003	Yeah, that's his line.
2208383	2209624	They are grown-ups, honestly.
2209644	2210345	They do this a lot.
2212182	2216497	We were now just over halfway, and amazingly, our cars were still running.
2217481	2217962	All of them.
2222779	2226040	The next day, in the centre of Maun, we got our next challenge.
2227500	2228721	The Glittering Golden Envelope.
2229081	2232942	You will drive your cars to Namibia through the Okavango Delta.
2233822	2236122	That's the really big wildlife place.
2236603	2245605	In the Okavango, you will encounter many deadly animals, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs, hippos, black rhino and crocodile.
2246445	2256350	Bird snakes, shield-nosed snakes, puff adders, boomslang, cape cobras, banded cobras, black mambas, black widows and thick-tailed scorpions.
2257791	2258791	What about the honey badger?
2259152	2259612	The what?
2260012	2262753	That's the least scary-sounding animal in the world.
2262874	2264674	A honey badger does not kill you to eat you.
2264855	2267016	It tears off your testicles.
2267356	2268216	It does not!
2268396	2269897	Why is it called a honey badger?
2269917	2271678	Because that's why it's made it angry.
2271698	2273099	Why isn't it called the badger of death?
2273996	2280160	In order to protect ourselves from the lions and the honey badgers, Jeremy and I would have to rebuild our cars.
2280900	2286023	But because we'd left all the bits on the other side of the salt pans, we had to use whatever we could find.
2286684	2287764	Did a lion eat this?
2289445	2292687	Who do I see about the corrugated metal?
2292707	2295549	I suppose I've had a practice, at least, with my lion drill.
2296309	2297510	Oh, no, there's a lion coming.
2297850	2298370	Ah, what shall I do?
2299071	2299291	That.
2300071	2300932	Oliver will protect me.
2302062	2305724	Because I had nothing to do, I decided to irritate Jeremy.
2305924	2307425	I want to go to that tarpaulin, then.
2308045	2308645	Tarpaulin?
2308885	2315609	Tarpaulin will defeat... Oh, no, it's well known, tarpaulin, for its almost military protective capabilities.
2315629	2319091	That's why you often see people going into war zones draped in tarpaulin.
2319231	2321112	Could you put a new door on a car?
2321572	2322092	Come and have a look.
2322112	2323053	I'll show you what I mean.
2323153	2325474	It's not sophisticated metalwork, this, but...
2334167	2338710	I would like a tarpaulin roof for a Lancia Beta Coupe, 1981.
2339751	2340151	We can.
2340291	2341893	We can make anything here.
2341953	2344154	Do you have any lion-proof tarpaulin?
2344294	2345515	So it's got to be, like, this thick.
2346336	2346696	Yeah.
2349935	2354478	One and a half metres by, say, one and a half metres.
2354598	2357499	If you think of a lion door, it'd be about that big.
2357740	2360061	Could you ignore him and make me that?
2366084	2373429	Because Mercedes were very popular in Africa, James soon found a spare door and boot lid for his car.
2377749	2381212	And while he was looking for more bits, I hatched a plan.
2382453	2384915	Look what I've got.
2384975	2385996	That's a cow's head.
2386257	2386457	Yeah.
2387458	2390540	Now, this will attract flies, which will make his life unpleasant.
2390600	2390840	Yes.
2391241	2397246	It will also attract lions, tigers... He effectively becomes a burger van, a driving van.
2398327	2401550	And to make sure the lions didn't miss... Oh, yeah, that's a whopper.
2401570	2402831	That's a whole lion there.
2406118	2407239	Oh, yeah, under the seat.
2408200	2410863	Oh, the smell will really... That'll be beautiful.
2412064	2415087	We also attached a cowbell to the underside of his car.
2415528	2418831	But while we were doing this, he was making merry with the paint.
2423376	2427360	That afternoon, we left Man and headed north to the Okavango Delta.
2430683	2433444	Right, my car now has been readied.
2433664	2435125	As you can see, I have a wooden door here.
2435145	2438486	It's a gull-wing, so I can get in and out, obviously.
2440687	2445769	God, this is like being in an allotment shed... on a very windy day.
2446549	2453492	On the left, I have all the cans that were in the car for the last few days have been arranged, and Fiesta Resistance.
2453732	2454873	Badgers, go away.
2465976	2466676	Mad Jeremy.
2466737	2470179	Police car.
2478704	2481485	Can anybody else smell burning or is it my car?
2482026	2483407	Is it like a barbecue smell?
2486809	2490431	As we neared the Okavango, the roads became rougher and rougher.
2491383	2497624	This is where the Big Ben comes into its own, really, because it's got good ground clearance, nothing... Bloody hell.
2498384	2506426	This is enough to shake the skulls from your bonnet, and nobody in the whole of human history has ever said that before.
2508107	2517408	So, just to summarise, viewers... As we went through the gates and into the game reserve, the road changed again, for the worse.
2518029	2518549	This is new.
2518749	2519869	Very soft sand.
2522952	2526515	To stop our cars bogging down, we had to drive as fast as possible.
2527776	2530198	We had ourselves another rally stage.
2535783	2540707	Amazingly, even Jeremy had his work cut out keeping up with the Opel.
2542108	2543910	Hammond's car just looks so composed.
2543990	2548213	I'm developing this irrational hatred of him and it.
2549715	2551056	This is such a good game.
2552188	2556512	Eventually, he was slowed down by a bridge over the river Kwai.
2560995	2564058	The rally stage had taken its toll on one of the cars.
2564438	2565919	Take a guess which one.
2565999	2571944	I'm in a car, which is even probably here, has got a throttle that's jammed wide open and I can't hold it on the brakes.
2572185	2572685	Hammond, move!
2572725	2575427	You're going to have to go faster than I hit you.
2575667	2575888	What?
2578107	2578687	Oh, God!
2578928	2579228	Thanks!
2579248	2581549	Well, help yourself to my brakes, why not?
2581729	2582790	I've lost a skull.
2582930	2583610	Monkeys.
2584110	2591654	I'm sorry, I can't... I just hit the throttle.
2591694	2592355	That's tick over.
2592395	2593575	Look, my leg's not on it.
2596657	2600619	Having blotched my throttle, we headed deeper into the Okavango.
2603861	2604942	Front, 12 o'clock.
2605102	2605482	One o'clock.
2607135	2611518	This is where wildlife cameramen come to make a name for themselves with David Attenborough.
2611978	2615741	But unfortunately, our film crew are best, really, with cars.
2615761	2617342	A giraffe on the right.
2618423	2618663	There.
2618683	2619463	The big thing.
2619483	2620064	Little fluffy clouds.
2623026	2625528	We have a programme called The Back End of an Animal.
2625548	2626849	Meet the boys to hire.
2627689	2629270	This week on Too Late to Look.
2629911	2632473	A moon on the left with animals with a baby on its back.
2633325	2638767	To give our crew a chance, we stopped and discovered that we weren't much good at animals either.
2640208	2640828	Wow, look!
2641188	2641428	Look!
2641969	2643069	A hippo's head.
2643089	2643829	Oh, it is!
2643849	2645430	Well, it's probably a whole hippo.
2645450	2646951	It's just the rest of him is under the water.
2648872	2651253	What does a hippo do just before it's about to attack?
2651473	2652273	Opens its mouth.
2652513	2652973	Opens its mouth.
2653033	2654094	It can open its jaw.
2654114	2655134	There's a thing it can do.
2656855	2657635	Oh, look!
2658616	2659676	Oh, look at that!
2660116	2661157	They stop for a drink.
2662199	2666060	using their noses to shovel water into their mouths.
2666241	2667821	Jeremy, that's a rubbish commentary.
2668561	2669522	James took over.
2670242	2673123	That one's lifting its paw up a bit like a dog does.
2673203	2673303	Paw.
2673563	2673783	Hoof.
2674103	2674364	Foot.
2674644	2675324	Whatever you call it.
2675564	2675904	Hoof.
2676504	2677645	Why is it on an elephant?
2677745	2678425	It's amazing.
2679125	2683387	There's a man over there with the best comb-over I have ever seen in my life.
2685708	2686048	That is...
2688874	2691335	He's got four partings as a result of that.
2691395	2691935	Let's see.
2692835	2694175	Why don't... You're bald.
2694535	2694975	Live with it.
2695435	2696556	Oops, he caught me looking.
2699356	2700697	I was looking through the... Sorry.
2700777	2703457	I was looking at the elephants, really.
2704437	2706258	Look at that sun now, boys.
2707038	2710659	Elephants, rally special stage, best comb-over I've ever seen.
2711139	2711779	Everything's here.
2725492	2730238	We camped by the river, and while James serviced his car, I hatched a plan.
2730578	2730918	Jeremy.
2732320	2732620	Jeremy.
2733441	2733762	Jeremy.
2734362	2734743	Quick, come here.
2735764	2735984	Come here.
2737005	2737746	It's the cow's head.
2737926	2739729	Yeah, well, it wasn't working in the boat.
2739909	2740469	I've had a better idea.
2740790	2740930	What?
2741210	2741431	Ten.
2742031	2742392	His ten?
2742532	2742732	Yeah.
2743032	2743693	Love your thinking.
2754831	2755531	What's that?
2755551	2757451	It was a hippo.
2758432	2758692	What?
2759692	2759992	Plugs.
2761012	2763953	That sounded very close.
2764253	2767593	Oh, my God, look at that.
2767613	2772214	Hippos spend all day in water and then they come out at night because... I can't remember why.
2773254	2773834	Well, thank you.
2773914	2774434	That's useful.
2774514	2774974	Thank you.
2776195	2778475	Oh, brilliant.
2778935	2783236	Look, do you want to go out there with the hippopotamus?
2784392	2786833	Or do you want to stay in here where the horse is sat?
2786853	2787894	That's not a question that's ever been asked.
2787914	2788654	It's not a horse, either.
2788694	2790455	It's a cow.
2791335	2791655	Hang on.
2792555	2794136	That's my bag in James's tent.
2794876	2796037	This is my tent!
2797438	2798578	Oh, man, get it out!
2801959	2806141	Our starting point at the Zimbabwe border felt like it was in another time zone.
2806581	2812484	But still, there were many miles of delta to cover, and our cars were in a really bad way.
2814778	2824647	The bush mechanic we have on the team took two cubic feet of sand out of my carburettor last night and asked if I wouldn't mind driving a bit more slowly today.
2827169	2828029	James, he's coming!
2830792	2835096	Our ordinary second-hand road cars were getting more and more out of their depth.
2835856	2837538	This is proper off-roading now.
2838976	2845360	Men in camouflage trousers in Wales, who like murdering people at weekends, would say this was tough going.
2845760	2848281	It was a whole... Oh!
2848742	2849362	What is it?
2849762	2850563	It's like iron.
2851523	2854905	I think I've bent the steering back a bit.
2856306	2856746	Wow!
2859108	2860769	Wow, there is an elephant right there.
2862410	2863090	A door there.
2865111	2866332	That would stop an elephant.
2869119	2874167	Soon our route was blocked by a river and what you're supposed to do is wade in to check the depth.
2876510	2876991	Right.
2878513	2881337	Jeremy made us drive on until he got bored.
2882118	2882739	Here, now.
2883809	2884589	No.
2885270	2889951	I agree with him, for once, actually, because that reedy stuff must mean it's shallow.
2890171	2892812	It's shallow where the reeds are, you fool.
2892832	2894633	We'll just drive over to where the reeds are, then.
2894653	2896854	Yes, but you've got to drive through the water to get there.
2897014	2897834	We can't keep going.
2897854	2899115	We've done 30 miles.
2899455	2903036	No, I'm frustrated, but you can't just drive into a river because you're bored.
2903456	2907758	I do a fair bit of off-roading, and I know enough that that's not the place to go across.
2907778	2908138	You're wrong.
2908278	2909038	I'm going through here.
2909058	2910279	Are you going to carry on?
2910899	2913301	Yeah, well, I will carry on if you're going to go through there.
2913541	2914622	Keep your radio on.
2914842	2915062	All right.
2915383	2915743	I'm going.
2917124	2918725	I'm not doing a four-by-four.
2919105	2919866	Okay, so edging.
2920086	2920707	Fan belts off.
2921307	2922468	Fan belts off is a good idea.
2922528	2924249	Cos it'll splash water into the distributors.
2924870	2928072	James went first and I said I'd watch for crocodiles.
2930174	2931975	Ooh, I say there's a ground hornbill over there.
2932296	2933316	It's getting deeper.
2933337	2935018	Ooh, hang on a minute.
2935378	2936539	Permission to say cock.
2937920	2938721	It's coming in!
2940441	2942203	Thunderbird one to the rescue.
2942223	2944645	Come on, I'm sinking by the bows.
2945205	2945626	Coming.
2950310	2951071	No!
2951531	2952612	I can't help you.
2952772	2953373	Come on.
2954073	2956616	James, I'm in a low, slow sports car.
2957056	2958097	I'm going down.
2960619	2961260	That's good.
2961780	2962341	Yes!
2962441	2964483	I've got water coming into my car.
2966982	2969304	I've got a wet bottom!
2969865	2971447	We're through!
2973209	2977514	Both our cars were flooded, but our guides weren't bothered at all.
2978215	2983842	People of Surrey, if this happens to you, you get water in the footwell and you need to drain it out, you're going to need a hole.
2983922	2986085	Well, the people of Botswana have a tip for you.
2999426	3003069	Meanwhile, using patience, I'd found a proper crossing point.
3005431	3009755	There is a technique to fording rivers, even on a proper ford like this.
3009775	3015640	You've got to keep enough speed up so you push a bow wave like that and you use whatever power you've got in the engine.
3015680	3016440	Come on.
3016460	3017161	Come on, come on.
3017581	3019103	Oh, my... No!
3021645	3022205	Oh, God!
3024963	3026023	He's stalled!
3026363	3027383	He's going down!
3027403	3029144	I can't open the door!
3029704	3043546	Oh, God!
3043927	3044387	Please!
3045067	3045627	Come out!
3046127	3046567	Come on!
3046807	3047227	Float!
3047687	3048167	Float!
3048807	3049288	Float!
3050568	3050868	Oliver!
3054246	3055366	Hammond, how's it going?
3056567	3058408	Well, I got a bit of water in him.
3058948	3061889	We did as well, but it doesn't matter because we used some rifles.
3061929	3063850	We shot the cars and the water's all drained out.
3063870	3064370	It's brilliant.
3065691	3065911	Good.
3068032	3069032	I might need the rifle.
3071693	3075835	As a local tourist truck pulled me out, the laughing hyenas arrived.
3080919	3083200	May gave his diagnosis.
3083601	3089544	Starting from the top, the battery's probably pretty knackered, and then the carburettor will be flooded, in a literal sense.
3089664	3092686	And then working down the distributor cap, that'll be full of water.
3093246	3097709	The engine itself, I mean, if a bit of water went into the cylinders, you might have compressed it and broken something.
3097729	3098549	The oil will be ruined.
3098569	3099290	I know all this.
3099450	3100330	I can fix him.
3100650	3102111	You are going to try and mend this?
3102371	3103652	If you'd leave me to it, yeah.
3104212	3104893	So we did.
3117406	3119108	Oh, that's harsh.
3119688	3120989	That is quite harsh, but go on.
3128156	3129497	Oh, I like this one.
3129857	3132579	It's sad, so sad.
3133640	3136263	It's a sad, sad situation.
3139790	3143072	Unfortunately, you can only give a man so much sympathy.
3143393	3145994	So James and I went ahead to make camp.
3150377	3155961	Hammond knew that in the morning, if his beloved Oliver wasn't fixed, he'd have to leave him behind.
3156662	3163667	So he got our bush mechanic to bring the generator down... ..and worked on through the night.
3175851	3178732	Morning came and still no Hammond.
3178832	3179973	What happened today?
3181813	3183374	I mean, I'm feeling quite like an explorer.
3183434	3187495	Is that Hammond?
3188536	3189976	Is it a beetle more to the point?
3194418	3195178	No way.
3205077	3205658	No way.
3206218	3206699	Oh, yeah.
3207259	3208100	Yeah, he's back.
3213104	3213825	And here's the best thing.
3213905	3215427	Do you remember the horn, which was rubbish?
3216147	3219090	No, it's excellent.
3221712	3223054	Is that technically possible?
3223274	3223794	Probably not.
3225356	3227518	For 47 years, I've never been speechless.
3230953	3235510	With all the cars defying all the odds, we began our final push to the border.
3238530	3241613	My car is working perfectly, as usual.
3242334	3243214	I've got no brakes.
3243415	3247698	The pedal goes straight to the floor and I have to declutch to stop, so I just tread on my own foot.
3247939	3249000	So I'm using the handbrake.
3249500	3249760	Ha!
3249880	3251322	The Lancia could beat that.
3251742	3256867	Every time I brake, it spears off to the right and I'm unable to steer left to correct that.
3257247	3261151	This has now gone from being a nuisance to being downright dangerous.
3262930	3267852	We soon reached the end of the Okavango, so we pulled over to remove the animal protection.
3268252	3269733	And then, guess what?
3269753	3273114	The Lancia simply would not get going again.
3273134	3281397	It now won't start, because the starter's only chosen this moment to pack up, but when it was running, it wouldn't move off in any of the gears.
3281417	3283838	It was just that last 60k.
3284139	3286179	It had that feel of a car that was dying.
3286199	3289541	Richard actually sympathised, because he'd been there.
3290241	3292442	As for James... A vehicle.
3295908	3297810	I'm not going to do it, but I'll push it.
3300492	3303975	Is this a good time to acknowledge that mine is the only one that has worked consistently?
3303995	3304336	No.
3307599	3308099	This is worrying.
3308139	3309360	I need to be home by Saturday.
3309380	3311522	I've been invited to a beetle drive.
3312863	3319990	The entire crew was working on the stricken beater until we were rewarded with the most glorious sound in the world.
3321571	3321831	Life.
3326553	3328255	I got a whole hundred yards.
3330157	3331698	I'm not stuck.
3332019	3334982	The idle speed's not good.
3335642	3336603	Bye, everybody.
3336663	3337504	I can't stop.
3337564	3338505	Please.
3339546	3340187	Please.
3341549	3345533	Soon, we hit the tarmac and we started to taste the hope.
3351502	3352562	Just 20 miles.
3352602	3353343	You can do that.
3353383	3354683	You've crossed Botswana.
3354723	3357164	No, I'm stuck in second, but second will do.
3357184	3364786	Obviously, I might have to keep going to the other side of the whole continent, but, you know... Come on, ten miles, please!
3366826	3370628	Then something really surprising happened.
3370668	3371588	Oh, no, not now.
3375393	3379756	Because the Lancia had been such a problem child, everyone was fed up with it.
3380137	3382819	Only two of the crew stayed behind to help.
3383439	3384420	The carburettor's gone.
3385921	3388483	Even if we can get that fixed, the starter motor is gone.
3388523	3393086	We've put it into gear, it goes into third and then that just stalls the engine and then you're back to square one again.
3394807	3397309	The Bordo was just five miles away.
3397429	3397930	There you go.
3397950	3400351	This is an object lesson for the owners of old cars everywhere.
3400391	3401993	You can drive them round the world.
3402253	3403514	Yeah, it's really relaxing.
3405940	3410182	Come on.
3410422	3411042	Order!
3411062	3412202	1,596 kilometres.
3412242	3413963	That's nearest I'm at 1,000 miles.
3414303	3417844	I've still got half a car left and very bad hair.
3422126	3423046	I don't believe that.
3426747	3428868	Sorry, I've got no brakes.
3429228	3429668	Yeah.
3435993	3436413	It's there.
3437733	3438354	We've done it!
3441254	3443035	All we had to do now was wait.
3443335	3445695	Wait to see which car Jeremy arrived in.
3448576	3449076	Is that an engine?
3449256	3449877	That's a car.
3452797	3455698	A mistakeable clatter of an air-cooled engine.
3456238	3457078	It's going to be the Beetle.
3458599	3459239	And it was.
3464497	3465758	But I wasn't driving it.
3466098	3470220	Yeah, I'm almost pleased.
3470260	3470940	Yes!
3473361	3474241	Oh, that's excellent.
3476202	3476562	Watch it!
3476602	3477503	Brakes don't work!
3478183	3479404	Sorry, there's no brakes.
3479684	3480584	Congratulations.
3480604	3481805	That's astonishing.
3485225	3488847	I think, realistically, we have to say the Lancia's won it.
3489267	3489948	Why?
3490548	3492009	By what possible measure?
3492029	3493570	No, you... It's the most surprising.
3493810	3494530	It's the worst.
3494910	3498152	No, well, you don't buy a second-hand car to be surprised that it still works.
3498192	3500033	It had to be rebuilt once a day.
3500053	3501614	Yeah, but you're right, it's rubbish.
3502549	3503810	Mercedes is the best car.
3504610	3504830	What?
3505351	3505951	What have I had to do?
3505991	3508212	I've had to change... Take the entire body off.
3508393	3509853	It's a showroom model, James.
3510254	3514436	All right, I admit that it's not entirely original, but in mechanical terms, it was perfect.
3514456	3515337	You cannot break it.
3515976	3521318	I think, honestly, we have to be magnanimous here, because only one of the cars has actually made it unmodified.
3522239	3525600	So, that brings us on to a Top Gear top tip.
3525800	3532624	If, people of Surrey, you want to replace your BMW X5 with something that's brilliant off-road... Simple.
3532884	3535885	Simple, inexpensive... Easy to maintain, surprisingly comfortable.
3536085	3536625	Absolutely.
3537506	3540027	Then you've got to get yourself a Volkswagen Beetle.
3541687	3541927	What?
3542127	3542588	It's true.
3542608	3543468	No, he's right.
3543588	3544008	It's true.
3544028	3544468	He's right.
3545329	3547850	You've replaced all the electrics in that car.
3554833	3563498	Tomorrow night at 8.50, it's more from the Top Gear lads with a Bolivia special as Jeremy, James and Richard are driving all the way to the coast of Chile from the heart of the jungle.
3563818	3566059	Let's hope they bring enough glove compartment snacks.
3566399	3568340	And up next, it's Sherlock on three.
