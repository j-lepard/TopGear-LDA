9	4771	Back up to strength, we pressed on, apart from Jeremy being Bill Oddie occasionally.
5051	6972	This is where flamingos breed out here.
7052	7932	So that's breeding, is it?
9553	10233	It's a fossil.
10614	11274	It's not a fossil.
11314	12895	It only died about two years ago.
12915	14015	I was talking about you.
14235	15156	It's an ex-flamingo.
15216	16056	Hey, no, look.
16296	17136	What now?
17877	19457	I know what created this.
20158	20638	Ostrich.
20878	21678	Yes!
22059	23479	Its legs are miles apart.
23499	25080	That's exactly how it was walking.
25868	28470	You know, David Attenborough's about to retire.
29291	30752	Can I just say... What?
31073	34576	You look like a gay cowboy and you look like a gay terrorist.
34696	38219	No, you look like a terrorist with a broken windscreen wiper and your face is ridiculous.
39260	41342	Ern Hammond started to pick on my car.
41382	42443	Why haven't you turned it on?
42703	44225	It's gathering electricity.
44305	46567	So if you turn it off, the battery's not going to start it again.
47107	47988	Turn it off and start it then.
48408	48729	Yeah, go on.
48969	49930	Turn it off and start it.
51206	53167	Let's have some beautiful silence.
53568	54068	Are you ready?
54348	54608	Yes.
55029	55609	Are you ready?
55889	56149	Yes.
59451	66196	Behold... Why did you turn it off, you idiot?
66236	68457	Because he said it would... Good luck, mate.
68497	70239	Somebody will give you a dub stop.
70299	71319	Don't go away.
71339	71860	Goodbye.
75396	78017	Annoyingly, Clarkson got the lancet going again.
79058	81299	And then we came across some big birds.
81379	81659	Wow!
81880	83660	And then we saw even more wildlife.
83681	85461	There's a cow.
85501	90584	Two cows, three cows.
91345	91485	Yes!
91505	91945	We've done it!
103407	105449	We had crossed the Mercati caddy.
106550	107491	Trees!
108412	108932	Life!
109413	112075	Mate, did you ever think that you'd do that?
112496	113497	I'm genuinely proud of him.
114418	114738	I am.
116059	121765	Really, I'm startled that this... that isn't a car anymore, whatever it is, has done it.
122475	126556	with its low-profile tyres and its low suspension that's broken.
126817	131938	Personally, I'm absolutely delighted because I think the Macaddy Caddy is one of the most unpleasant places I've ever been.
132539	134359	It's just a big bowl of dust.
134379	134979	Hello, mate.
138241	145463	Widow Twankey may have been glad to see the back of the salt pans, but despite this, they gave us a startling parting gift.
149264	150405	Wow, that is amazing.
151246	152987	That's the moon.
153007	153887	Yeah, that's the moon.
153927	158889	Because of the dust from the pans, you get... A moonrise in orange.
159789	160669	I've got goosebumps.
162570	164370	I know a Philip Larkin poem about the moon.
164390	165371	Would you like to hear it?
165451	165651	No.
171093	174294	As a new day dawned, our cars looked like wrecks.
175594	177755	But their ordeal was far from over.
180399	185583	Yes, we had crossed the salt pans, but we were still only a third of the way across Botswana.
186184	190167	And now we were about to enter the Kalahari.
197873	198554	Kalahari.
200615	204038	Everyone who comes to the Kalahari takes away a different memory of it.
204298	207841	Savagery, the simplicity, the vast heat.
208102	209663	Me, I think bumpiness.
211494	217521	It was as rough as hell, so we were glad when news came through that we were to stop at the next village.
220063	232697	Obviously, they recognise a truly classy car.
236570	239955	What could they possibly have in mind for us here?
245123	246365	It was another challenge.
247106	247547	Hello.
248468	248848	Here it is.
250922	253363	Your cars have travelled far and suffered much.
253383	253903	Yes, they have.
254543	261806	So we will now discover how much performance they've lost in a competition against the clock on a rally special stage.
262246	263866	Mine can't have lost any performance.
263926	265307	It never added any.
265467	267667	And I'm not going to ruin my Mercedes just for a few points.
268808	271449	You're right, you're not, because you're not driving it.
271589	272029	Well, who is?
273231	282523	Some say he's seen the Lion King 1,780 times, and that his second best friend is a Cape buffalo.
283444	289011	All we know is he's not the Stig, but he is the Stig's African cousin.
