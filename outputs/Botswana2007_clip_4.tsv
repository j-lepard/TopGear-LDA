11291	17093	Day two on the salt pans, and we'd been told that today our problem would not be mud, but dust.
17714	21355	That meant James and I had to rethink our wardrobe solutions.
27218	30219	I've teamed my koi with a bin liner.
30239	31539	V-necked.
31900	34641	The last time I wore one of these, I'd seen a clash.
35681	37442	Frankly, I thought it was all a bit much.
37502	39523	I mean, how bad could this dust be?
42589	43069	My eyes!
43809	45510	Crikey, I can't even see Jezza already.
48090	53011	Oh, no, no, no, no.
54971	59672	Meanwhile, in my unmodified cadet... I'm going to adjust my quarter light a bit.
59912	61452	Just an inch.
61532	61972	That's better.
62933	69714	I can feel the heat there.
70534	70934	It's nice.
72687	73708	The kakai's come off.
76909	77309	Hello?
78609	82771	James and I made it through the dust with our lives considerably shortened.
85171	87192	I've got consumption and TB.
88312	90693	I've got every single 1920s disease.
92494	94394	And then Lord Smug piped up.
94854	99976	I had to close this at one point, just about that much, and then it pulls the air out and you just get fresh air through, it's nice.
102093	105135	You know what it's like when someone punches you really hard in the middle of the face?
105215	105855	I do, actually.
106916	109078	Then the surface got even worse.
113981	116803	It was like we were descending through the seven circles of hell.
130114	136137	I'd assumed it'd be the salt that would kill the notoriously rust-prone Lancia, but it was the rough going.
136437	140379	Even though it had now smoothed out again, the beater was in a bad way.
141079	141579	I've gone.
141659	142019	I've gone.
142199	142960	Are you conking out?
143820	145181	I've got no power, no drive.
145201	147282	Do you remember what the man said, Jeremy?
147902	149442	Breakdown and you... What is it?
149563	150343	Have a nice time?
150383	150823	No, die.
150843	159487	Well, that's loose.
161089	161709	That's hot.
164971	171155	It is a good job they cantered this engine over by 20 degrees, because that means it's more inaccessible than it would otherwise have been.
171175	172616	Oh, my God, look at this.
183663	185644	I've got to say, it has been nice, the piece.
186124	187305	You know, not having him around.
190305	195687	I've checked the alternator, the spark plugs, the HT leads and the distributor cap.
196628	197968	Poked around with the starter solenoid.
197988	200589	There's been faults with all of them, but it still isn't going.
201710	206132	I'm not sure which I favour most here, certain death or that beetle.
208773	210873	Come off!
226454	227715	I honestly believe it's had it.
232939	234260	It's my car on the crab.
234981	236943	No, it's tracking Troentruve.
237183	239144	He's worried about tracking, and look at it.
240866	245550	We knew that Jeremy would eventually catch us up, but what would he be driving?
248552	249913	I can see something in the mirrors.
252415	253456	Please let it be a beetle.
254237	255538	I do hope it's a beetle.
256718	258319	Please, please let it be a Beetle.
258619	259880	Please let it be a Beetle.
261921	265563	I'm back!
266524	268004	Oh, Jeremy, well done.
268064	269665	I'm disappointed... Sorry, delighted.
270006	271566	You're not in a Beetle!
271787	272867	Not a Beetle.
273027	276009	A fully functioning Lancia Beetle Coupe.
276329	279671	I just wanted the Beetle to pounce on you when you were straying behind.
280592	281352	I'm gutted.
282553	284033	Shall we just sandwich him, James?
284314	284574	No!
286481	299931	With their convoy back on the road,
