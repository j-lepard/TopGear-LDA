549	1530	Oh, yeah, that's a whopper.
1550	2850	That's a whole lion there.
4291	8372	Oh, yeah, under the seat.
8492	10893	Oh, the smell will really... That'll be beautiful.
12074	15095	We also attached a cowbell to the underside of his car.
15515	18877	But while we were doing this, he was making merry with the paint.
23358	27360	That afternoon, we left Man and headed north to the Okavango Delta.
30683	33444	Right, my car now has been readied.
33664	35125	As you can see, I have a wooden door here.
35145	38486	It's a gull-wing, so I can get in and out, obviously.
40687	45769	God, this is like being in an allotment shed... on a very windy day.
46549	53492	On the left, I have all the cans that were in the car for the last few days have been arranged, and Fiesta Resistance.
53732	54873	Badgers, go away.
65976	66676	Mad Jeremy.
66736	70178	Police car.
78702	81484	Can anybody else smell burning or is it my car?
82024	83404	Is it like a barbecue smell?
86806	90428	As we neared the Okavango, the roads became rougher and rougher.
91383	97624	This is where the Big Ben comes into its own, really, because it's got good ground clearance, nothing... Bloody hell.
98384	106426	This is enough to shake the skulls from your bonnet, and nobody in the whole of human history has ever said that before.
108107	117408	So, just to summarise, viewers... As we went through the gates and into the game reserve, the road changed again, for the worse.
118029	118549	This is new.
118749	119869	Very soft sand.
122952	126515	To stop our cars bogging down, we had to drive as fast as possible.
127776	130198	We had ourselves another rally stage.
135783	140707	Amazingly, even Jeremy had his work cut out keeping up with the Opel.
142108	143910	Hammond's car just looks so composed.
143990	148213	I'm developing this irrational hatred of him and it.
149715	151056	This is such a good game.
152188	156512	Eventually, he was slowed down by a bridge over the river Kwai.
160995	164058	The rally stage had taken its toll on one of the cars.
164438	165919	Take a guess which one.
165999	171944	I'm in a car, which is even probably here, has got a throttle that's jammed wide open and I can't hold it on the brakes.
172185	172685	Hammond, move!
172725	175427	You're going to have to go faster than I hit you.
175667	175888	What?
178107	178687	Oh, God!
178928	179228	Thanks!
179248	181549	Well, help yourself to my brakes, why not?
181729	182790	I've lost a skull.
182930	183610	Monkeys.
184110	191654	I'm sorry, I can't... I just hit the throttle.
191694	192355	That's tick over.
192395	193575	Look, my leg's not on it.
196657	200619	Having blotched my throttle, we headed deeper into the Okavango.
203861	204942	Front, 12 o'clock.
205102	205482	One o'clock.
207135	211518	This is where wildlife cameramen come to make a name for themselves with David Attenborough.
211978	215741	But unfortunately, our film crew are best, really, with cars.
215761	217342	A giraffe on the right.
218423	218663	There.
218683	219463	The big thing.
219483	220064	Little fluffy clouds.
223026	225528	We have a programme called The Back End of an Animal.
225548	226849	Meet the boys to hire.
227689	229270	This week on Too Late to Look.
229911	232473	A moon on the left with animals with a baby on its back.
233325	238767	To give our crew a chance, we stopped and discovered that we weren't much good at animals either.
240208	240828	Wow, look!
241188	241428	Look!
241969	243069	A hippo's head.
243089	243829	Oh, it is!
243849	245430	Well, it's probably a whole hippo.
245450	246951	It's just the rest of him is under the water.
248872	251253	What does a hippo do just before it's about to attack?
251473	252273	Opens its mouth.
252513	252973	Opens its mouth.
253033	254094	It can open its jaw.
254114	255134	There's a thing it can do.
256855	257635	Oh, look!
258616	259676	Oh, look at that!
260116	261157	They stop for a drink.
262199	266060	using their noses to shovel water into their mouths.
266241	267821	Jeremy, that's a rubbish commentary.
268561	269522	James took over.
270242	273123	That one's lifting its paw up a bit like a dog does.
273203	273303	Paw.
273563	273783	Hoof.
274103	274364	Foot.
274644	275324	Whatever you call it.
275564	275904	Hoof.
276504	277645	Why is it on an elephant?
277745	278425	It's amazing.
279125	283387	There's a man over there with the best comb-over I have ever seen in my life.
285708	286048	That is...
288894	291298	He's got four partings as a result of that.
291318	291979	Let's see.
292840	294202	Why don't... You're bald.
294543	294963	Live with it.
295484	296406	Oops, he called me back.
299370	299951	I was looking through...
