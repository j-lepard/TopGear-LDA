9	1709	I'm digging in as I'm driving along.
1729	4690	I think a little bit more has to come out.
5390	9071	Still, as you can see from the tyres' grooves, I was doing better than the Merc.
12252	15313	I'm looking at James's rear wheel and he's digging in a long way.
16113	17493	I tried to help him along.
17513	21074	It's really helpful.
21834	23655	Well, he's always the beetle, James.
24355	25215	It's waiting for you.
28902	29583	What are you going to do?
29643	30344	It's sinking.
30424	32406	Honestly, we've done... How far is that, a mile?
32887	33287	It's there.
34288	36070	My Lancia waded in again.
36771	37432	Just a nudge.
38373	39034	That's a crash.
39174	39695	There's a thing.
40596	43880	Unfortunately, because it was an automatic, it was useless.
44440	46042	So we told Richard to try.
47043	48865	But he didn't want to hurt Oliver.
53888	57449	This was hopeless, so we had to rope in the camera crew.
57989	66811	Three, two, one... Because the ooze was so bad, we had to get even more drastic with the weight-shedding.
70192	71912	We toiled away for hours.
71932	76353	Well, two of us did.
77053	79614	And then, finally, we were ready.
82895	83775	Now, this is light.
84135	86976	Lancia, Beta, Coupe, Superleggera.
92979	94019	Not a modification.
96680	97620	This is excellent.
97740	100021	Why don't all cars have no doors?
101802	105123	When I come to power, I'm going to make it a rule, because this is just better.
111539	120141	However, the Mercati Caddy was not going to let us off that lightly, and soon even our super lightweight cars started to struggle again.
123122	124842	Come on, just... Oh.
125962	126083	Oh.
127183	127543	Oh, yes.
129223	130484	No, this isn't good.
133924	134605	Oh, no.
136105	140146	Only the Opel remained trouble-free, which was bad news for me.
142489	143149	Yes!
143410	144210	Come on, man.
144830	147012	I'll go forward, Sam, and then we'll do it again.
147032	147292	Hang on.
149273	150074	How far is it?
150594	152855	Another five or six yards and we might be bobbing.
153055	154476	Oh, this is just horrible.
158178	159199	Keep going, keep going, keep going.
159559	160760	Keep going.
161260	161540	Yes!
162421	162641	Yes!
164602	165383	No.
165863	167024	James, don't go there.
167044	168044	You'll get stuck.
168304	168905	That's close.
174807	176088	Oh, for goodness' sake.
176489	178150	We have everybody, we'll push it off.
178190	179751	We need 100 men or more.
182714	183594	This is hopeless.
186096	189559	People of Surrey, you need four-wheel drive for this bit.
191201	195905	The gunk was so sticky, it had completely jammed the Lancia's rear wheels.
197586	198646	I can't describe it.
199707	200868	You just think it's just mud.
200888	201709	Do you know what it is?
202730	203010	Fish.
203671	206834	It's just rotted, prehistoric fish.
207454	209136	One, two, three.
212399	216202	Mercifully, the ground eventually hardened and we made good progress.
216943	220286	But then suddenly, the horizon was no longer flat.
225066	228107	Now, this is interesting, because we're now coming between what look like islands.
229127	229968	And I suppose they are.
229988	232068	This was a lake, so they would have been islands.
232489	233269	Amazing.
233529	242912	Absolutely amazing.
247234	247654	Where are we?
249194	250475	It's called Kubu Island.
253036	253616	We're about...
255782	257003	A third of the way across.
257743	259724	And you've been stuck about a thousand times.
260044	261445	That is smug.
261925	262825	A baobab tree.
263525	264586	Always wanted to see one of those.
265546	266447	Hammond, look at this.
267707	276451	Whoa!
276851	279852	It is just about the most astonishing place I've ever been.
280673	281373	Kind of witty there.
289884	292756	As the sun set, we headed for the campsite.
