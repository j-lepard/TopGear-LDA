149	3852	built in Russia, where it became the Moskvitch, which was rubbish.
4772	8775	And, of course, indirectly, the Vauxhall Astra.
8815	12458	Quite a lot of reasonably average cars owe themselves to this.
12478	24227	I don't know if you know, but Africa is really quite large, and when you're out in a very remote part, you need a car like this, that can be mended with a brick and a piece of string.
25117	31388	What you have to remember is that three of the most rugged and successful rally cars ever made were Lancia's.
31989	35615	The Stratos, the 037 and the Delta Integrale.
36016	39001	Lancia know how to make a rally car.
40732	45897	Unfortunately, on the day my beauté coupé was made, they obviously forgot everything.
46598	51462	The gearbox is broken, the steering's broken, the window's broken.
51722	53424	In fact, we all had problems.
54145	58429	Everything works except this knob, which controls the blood.
58829	62791	I've got to have the windows open because there's quite a strong smell of petrol.
63291	65752	And that mirror over there, which is actually slightly stuck.
66352	70514	Hazard warning lights, the clock, the fan, the handbrake, all of the dials.
70855	73256	The brakes are terrible because they only work on that wheel.
73436	76317	They work very well on that wheel, but only on that wheel.
77117	78638	And that instrument's a bit wobbly.
78658	82560	Apart from that, everything that's actually important to the car works perfectly.
83560	86882	Apart from the handbrake, which I can pull like this as we go along.
88453	93758	Nevertheless, because we were on tarmac roads, we decided to give our cars a shakedown.
94258	95379	Building up speed now.
95799	97321	When it was made, this car had 116 horsepower.
97341	98662	Top speed, 115 miles an hour.
98682	99863	Here we go.
99903	101925	Going 100 kilometres an hour more.
110006	111267	Right, I'm going to overtake the truck.
111307	111687	Here I go.
112248	113769	He's pulled out of its slipstream.
114329	116851	Well, it's really coming up.
116871	116851	105.
118393	121055	Still truck.
121075	121055	105.
121515	122216	Still truck.
124838	122216	105.
124858	124958	3,000 revs, 3,500.
125078	125698	Pulls cleanly.
125798	126659	Hang on a minute.
126779	134505	It's got no fifth gear.
135126	138969	Somebody's put the knob from a five-gear model on it.
142162	145504	This is just the happiest car in the world.
145625	146465	As we call it, Oliver.
146485	148667	Not that we'd ever name a car on top of it.
148687	149567	I wish I hadn't said that.
151108	155892	It's now five past ten in the morning and it's starting to get quite hot.
156392	157293	I've got an idea.
164738	165219	Oh, yeah.
165619	166139	That's better.
166159	168241	Don't know what that is.
171647	174148	The horn!
174168	175689	Oliver, you've got a cold!
175749	176129	Listen!
180432	184734	We were having fun, but then we discovered we were travelling with Bill Oddie.
185202	185822	Why have you got a pen?
185922	187242	You tick them off when you've seen them.
187622	189263	Hornbill, southern yellowbill.
189763	190903	Take a look at your car.
191063	192363	It's massive!
192864	193604	Don't knock Oliver.
193624	194784	Don't knock my car.
194804	197925	That's a fine... He's a fine... What did you call it, then?
198425	200605	Oliver's a friend of mine and I thought you were talking about him.
200625	201845	He's given it a name.
201905	207567	He's given his car a name.
207607	209487	So far, the journey had been a doddle.
212659	215641	Then the tarmac just sort of stopped.
222066	222887	Oh, this is bad.
223347	227371	I can see from here just how hard the suspension on Jeremy's Lance is having to work.
227431	228331	It's just a blur.
231614	232955	Come on, Oliver, please!
233936	237098	The later you book a lift in the Mercedes, the more expensive it gets.
237158	238219	It's a bit like an airline.
238239	238800	Oh, God!
239180	239700	Oh!
242866	244447	Engine isn't working, it's cut out.
244807	245407	Oh, dear.
245787	248228	He's done literally one kilometre of this.
248469	249229	I know what's wrong with it.
249449	250209	The bonnet won't open.
250289	251510	Yeah, it's the bonnet catch.
251850	252391	Shut up!
253071	256032	Hammond was tetchy because he knew the price of failure.
256553	260855	Anyone whose car broke down would have to complete the journey in a beetle.
266187	268588	It is collectively our least favourite car in the world.
268929	269329	Oh, yes.
269469	270349	It is the punishment.
270930	271510	Please!
272871	273891	Oh, hang on, hang on.
275432	277974	Oh!
278054	279434	Come on, Oliver!
279815	280395	What did you say?
280415	283437	I said, I love you!
283617	284257	Oh, my God.
284657	285137	What now?
285518	288079	My car's on fire, but in a very specific place.
288659	289520	Wow, look at that.
289540	291021	It's a magnifying glass.
291041	292622	There's a laser beam coming through it.
294234	295558	Oh, his piece of cardboard's gone.
296260	297804	So it sets itself on fire?
298145	299570	If you don't have a piece of cardboard.
