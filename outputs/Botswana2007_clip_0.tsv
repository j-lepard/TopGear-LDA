21467	23068	Hello, hello, and welcome.
23108	24029	Thank you very much.
24049	34256	Now, as you know, the producers on this show like to give us challenges, specifically where they give us a very small amount of money and tell us to buy a used car.
34597	39640	Then they set unbelievably hard tasks to do to see which one of us got the best deal.
39900	40080	Yeah.
40541	44043	This week, for a Top Gear special, they came up with a real humdinger.
44423	50408	They gave each of us 1,500 quid and told us to go to Africa and buy a car.
51108	52829	Yeah, there were just two conditions.
53149	57990	It mustn't be four-wheel drive, and it mustn't be built in any way to go off-road.
63772	68174	The meeting point was the border post between Zimbabwe and Botswana.
68974	71735	And, for once, I was the first to arrive.
75069	77350	Now, as you'd expect, I've done this properly.
77450	92156	What I've got is a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 230e, a car that Africa absolutely adores, because it's comfortable, it's rugged, it's dependable, and frankly, if the other two have brought anything other than one of these along, they're idiots.
93937	95497	The first idiot arrived.
95557	99119	Can you open the door?
99299	100179	The handle's broken.
100860	102060	It is a Lancia Beta.
102220	102440	Coupé, 1981.
104969	108392	The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of Botswana.
108652	111054	It's done 29,000 miles.
112455	113076	One owner, is it?
113096	115158	It's the little old lady.
115878	117520	And boy, had she ragged it.
118060	119101	Yeah, that's normal, isn't it?
120022	120642	That fizzing?
121483	123505	That's... Yeah.
124145	125406	What's the piece of cardboard for?
125446	126667	Is that for mopping up moisture?
127088	129970	No, that's because the battery... Oh, it shorts on the bonnet?
129990	131111	Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
131631	132212	You've done well.
133840	134240	So, now what?
134260	134801	Do you want a lift?
135762	139525	We left the Lancia to cool down, because Hammond was arriving.
140526	141407	– What the hell is that?
141427	142007	– I don't know.
143268	144389	Could it be a Moskvitch?
144409	146371	– It's an Opel.
146391	147172	– Opel?
147192	149033	And on the front it says Cadet.
149053	149133	Yeah!
149354	155119	What the hell have you done, man?
155419	156960	It's an Opel Cadet from 1963.
159966	162207	So that's the same age as... That's the same age as Nick.
162267	164208	Yes, but it's much better Nick than you.
164608	164788	It was £1,200.
164948	168009	I had much change with which to buy many beans.
168249	169509	How much more simple can you get?
169569	173671	It's got two moving parts and it's been here for 44 years.
173931	174911	I love the speedo.
175031	177212	I do like a horizontal speedo.
177352	177952	I really do.
178132	178792	Where's the engine?
178932	179652	It's there.
179672	180313	Hang on.
180953	181873	It's tiny.
181893	183034	Do you want to know about the power?
183434	183814	Yes, I do.
184844	185204	Forty.
185404	187005	Forty horsepower.
187045	190446	Well, they did do a sport version with 48, but I didn't want anything too lairy.
194307	195287	You've both been idiots.
195788	196128	No.
196328	199289	Brilliantly interesting, brilliantly stylish, but stupid.
199409	201029	Why is mine stupid?
201249	201910	Where is yours?
204230	206531	Anansi, you have been a bit thick.
208032	211433	With the cars at the start line, it was time for our challenge.
216266	221890	The people of Surrey think they need four-wheel drive cars because they live up a lane which sometimes has leaves on it.
222270	235659	You will now attempt to prove them wrong by driving your two-wheel drive cars from here on Botswana's eastern border with Zimbabwe, which is there, 1,000 miles to its western border with Namibia.
236540	239402	That's right across the spine of Africa.
245433	246234	I'm confident.
247474	247935	I wasn't.
250376	253338	We hadn't even started, and the Lancia was playing up.
262364	264045	James chose not to wait.
265806	274151	He may be mechanically confident, but he has just turned right, which is simply a bomb wing, which is where I should point out the BBC is not allowed.
276889	277790	Sorry, sorry.
277930	278691	I'm going now.
281614	285517	The Lancia wheezed into life and Hammond and I set off in pursuit.
285657	299831	If you think of the cars that this inspired, it was Latin.
