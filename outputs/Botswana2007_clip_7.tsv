169	1811	Guys, you know what we're driving through?
2752	3252	Plants.
4073	5214	No, this is a weed.
5314	7917	It grows locally and it's hallucinogenic.
8457	10139	What did you say?
13543	18087	If any car was going to get stuck, we would have put money on the Lance here, but no.
18107	19949	All right, mate?
20289	20650	Sorry.
21931	22632	Horn doesn't work.
24261	26302	Clearly, I'd have to get myself out.
26803	31586	I'm going to make a rudimentary temporary road for my back wheel.
31606	33367	Thank God.
34528	36869	Eventually, we found a smoother track.
37690	38150	Whoa!
38710	41852	And I did a detailed analysis of the Lancia's conditioning.
42393	42953	Sit-rep.
44274	46595	It's all broken.
46615	49057	As darkness fell, we found the road to Mamm.
49357	51839	But by this stage, even Oliver was suffering.
52398	53359	I can't use my lights.
53719	56422	Alternator's packed up all full of dirt and dust.
56823	60326	If I put the lights on, I can have the lights, but not the engine, because it all dies.
60867	72258	So I've actually got Jonathan, who brings all the cameras and does all that for us, in here with me, lighting me when I talk to you with the torch, which he then uses to light the road ahead when I'm not talking to you.
80985	82806	Finally, we rolled into Man.
85548	87630	Which year was it made?
87970	87630	1981.
88290	92253	It's just driven all the way from Zimbabwe to here without going on a road.
92273	93053	Like this?
93273	93493	Yeah.
95755	97316	Get out of the way of the pub.
98197	99217	I shall move it for you.
99237	101239	If you ask politely, I will move it.
107163	108003	Yeah, that's his line.
108383	109624	They are grown-ups, honestly.
109644	110345	They do this a lot.
112182	116497	We were now just over halfway, and amazingly, our cars were still running.
117481	117962	All of them.
122779	126040	The next day, in the centre of Maun, we got our next challenge.
127500	128721	The Glittering Golden Envelope.
129081	132942	You will drive your cars to Namibia through the Okavango Delta.
133822	136122	That's the really big wildlife place.
136603	145605	In the Okavango, you will encounter many deadly animals, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, wild dogs, hippos, black rhino and crocodile.
146445	156350	Bird snakes, shield-nosed snakes, puff adders, boomslang, cape cobras, banded cobras, black mambas, black widows and thick-tailed scorpions.
157791	158791	What about the honey badger?
159152	159612	The what?
160012	162753	That's the least scary-sounding animal in the world.
162874	164674	A honey badger does not kill you to eat you.
164855	167016	It tears off your testicles.
167356	168216	It does not!
168396	169897	Why is it called a honey badger?
169917	171678	Because that's why it's made it angry.
171698	173099	Why isn't it called the badger of death?
173996	180160	In order to protect ourselves from the lions and the honey badgers, Jeremy and I would have to rebuild our cars.
180900	186023	But because we'd left all the bits on the other side of the salt pans, we had to use whatever we could find.
186684	187764	Did a lion eat this?
189445	192687	Who do I see about the corrugated metal?
192707	195549	I suppose I've had a practice, at least, with my lion drill.
196309	197510	Oh, no, there's a lion coming.
197850	198370	Ah, what shall I do?
199071	199291	That.
200071	200932	Oliver will protect me.
202062	205724	Because I had nothing to do, I decided to irritate Jeremy.
205924	207425	I want to go to that tarpaulin, then.
208045	208645	Tarpaulin?
208885	215609	Tarpaulin will defeat... Oh, no, it's well known, tarpaulin, for its almost military protective capabilities.
215629	219091	That's why you often see people going into war zones draped in tarpaulin.
219231	221112	Could you put a new door on a car?
221572	222092	Come and have a look.
222112	223053	I'll show you what I mean.
223153	225474	It's not sophisticated metalwork, this, but...
234167	238710	I would like a tarpaulin roof for a Lancia Beta Coupe, 1981.
239751	240151	We can.
240291	241893	We can make anything here.
241953	244154	Do you have any lion-proof tarpaulin?
244294	245515	So it's got to be, like, this thick.
246336	246696	Yeah.
249935	254478	One and a half metres by, say, one and a half metres.
254598	257499	If you think of a lion door, it'd be about that big.
257740	260061	Could you ignore him and make me that?
266084	273429	Because Mercedes were very popular in Africa, James soon found a spare door and boot lid for his car.
277749	281193	And while he was looking for more bits, I hatched a plan.
282474	284916	Look what I've got.
284976	285997	That's a cow's head.
286258	286458	Yeah.
287459	290542	Now, this will attract flies, which will make his life unpleasant.
290602	290842	Yes.
291182	297268	It will also attract lions, tigers... He effectively becomes a burger van for driving.
298329	299991	And to make sure the lions didn't miss,
