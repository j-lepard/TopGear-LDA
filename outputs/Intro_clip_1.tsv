49	9783	Africa absolutely adores, because it's comfortable, it's rugged, it's dependable, and frankly, if the other two have brought anything other than one of these along, they're idiots.
11546	13308	The first idiot arrived.
16004	17805	Can you open the door, because the handle's broken?
18405	19665	It is a Lancia Beta.
19825	20386	Coupe, 1981.
20826	26028	The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of Botswana.
26268	28689	It's done 29,000 miles.
30069	30689	One owner, is it?
31850	32750	A little old lady.
33511	35111	And boy, had she ragged it.
35671	36732	Yeah, that's normal, isn't it?
37632	38332	That fizzing.
39093	39393	That's...
40856	41136	Yeah.
41737	43018	What's the piece of cardboard for?
43038	44259	Is that for mopping up moisture?
44659	47561	No, that's because the battery... Oh, it shorts on the bonnet?
47601	48582	Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
48602	48742	Right.
49243	49823	You've done well.
51424	51865	So now what?
51885	52445	Do you want a lift?
53386	57249	We left the Lancia to cool down because Hammond was arriving.
57269	59030	What the hell is that?
59090	59571	I don't know.
