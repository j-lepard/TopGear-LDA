I'm digging in as I'm driving along.
I think a little bit more has to come out.
Still, as you can see from the tyres' grooves, I was doing better than the Merc.
I'm looking at James's rear wheel and he's digging in a long way.
I tried to help him along.
It's really helpful.
Well, he's always the beetle, James.
It's waiting for you.
What are you going to do?
It's sinking.
Honestly, we've done... How far is that, a mile?
It's there.
My Lancia waded in again.
Just a nudge.
That's a crash.
There's a thing.
Unfortunately, because it was an automatic, it was useless.
So we told Richard to try.
But he didn't want to hurt Oliver.
This was hopeless, so we had to rope in the camera crew.
Three, two, one... Because the ooze was so bad, we had to get even more drastic with the weight-shedding.
We toiled away for hours.
Well, two of us did.
And then, finally, we were ready.
Now, this is light.
Lancia, Beta, Coupe, Superleggera.
Not a modification.
This is excellent.
Why don't all cars have no doors?
When I come to power, I'm going to make it a rule, because this is just better.
However, the Mercati Caddy was not going to let us off that lightly, and soon even our super lightweight cars started to struggle again.
Come on, just... Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
No, this isn't good.
Oh, no.
Only the Opel remained trouble-free, which was bad news for me.
Yes!
Come on, man.
I'll go forward, Sam, and then we'll do it again.
Hang on.
How far is it?
Another five or six yards and we might be bobbing.
Oh, this is just horrible.
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
Keep going.
Yes!
Yes!
No.
James, don't go there.
You'll get stuck.
That's close.
Oh, for goodness' sake.
We have everybody, we'll push it off.
We need 100 men or more.
This is hopeless.
People of Surrey, you need four-wheel drive for this bit.
The gunk was so sticky, it had completely jammed the Lancia's rear wheels.
I can't describe it.
You just think it's just mud.
Do you know what it is?
Fish.
It's just rotted, prehistoric fish.
One, two, three.
Mercifully, the ground eventually hardened and we made good progress.
But then suddenly, the horizon was no longer flat.
Now, this is interesting, because we're now coming between what look like islands.
And I suppose they are.
This was a lake, so they would have been islands.
Amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
Where are we?
It's called Kubu Island.
We're about...
A third of the way across.
And you've been stuck about a thousand times.
That is smug.
A baobab tree.
Always wanted to see one of those.
Hammond, look at this.
Whoa!
It is just about the most astonishing place I've ever been.
Kind of witty there.
As the sun set, we headed for the campsite.
