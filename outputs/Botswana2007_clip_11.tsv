498	3960	Is this a good time to acknowledge that mine is the only one that has worked consistently?
4000	4320	No.
7602	8103	This is worrying.
8143	9363	I need to be home by Saturday.
9383	11525	I've been invited to a beetle drive.
12866	19990	The entire crew was working on the stricken beater until we were rewarded with the most glorious sound in the world.
20830	21131	Life.
21371	21931	It lives!
22771	26274	It lives!
26534	28255	I got a whole hundred yards.
30211	31211	I'm not stuck.
32051	33632	The idle speed's not good.
35632	36593	Bye, everybody.
36673	37533	I can't stop.
37873	38493	Please.
39533	40174	Please.
41534	45535	Soon, we hit the tarmac and we started to taste the hope.
51516	52577	Just 20 miles.
52597	53357	You can do that.
53377	54677	You've crossed Botswana.
54717	57038	Now, I'm stuck in second, but second will do.
58314	64795	Obviously, mine would keep going to the other side of the whole continent, but, you know... Come on, ten miles, please!
66836	70637	Then something really surprising happened.
70657	71697	Oh, no, not now.
73257	73637	Please!
75378	79739	Because the Lancia had been such a problem child, everyone was fed up with it.
80139	82819	Only two of the crew stayed behind to help.
83460	84380	Carburettors gone.
85911	88473	Even if we can get that fixed, the starter motor is gone.
88513	93056	We put it into gear, it goes into third, and then that just stalls the engine and then you're back to square one again.
94798	96699	The Bordo was just five miles away.
97419	97920	There you go.
97940	100342	This is an object lesson for the owners of old cars everywhere.
100382	101983	You can drive them round the world.
102263	103544	Yeah, it's really relaxing.
103884	106266	Come on.
107367	107707	Bordo!
110576	112196	1,596 kilometres.
112236	113977	That's near as damn it a thousand miles.
114297	117839	I've still got half a car left and very bad hair.
121920	123041	I don't believe that.
126722	128843	Sorry, I've got no brakes.
131824	132104	Yeah.
136006	136406	It's there.
137747	138347	We've done it.
141252	145755	All we had to do now was wait, wait to see which car Jeremy arrived in.
148576	149077	Is that an engine?
149257	149877	That's a car.
152799	155581	A mistakeable clatter of an air-cooled engine.
156241	157082	It's going to be the Beetle.
158603	159303	And it was.
164486	165707	But I wasn't driving it.
169158	170219	Yeah, I'm almost pleased.
170259	170919	Yes!
173360	174241	Oh, that's excellent.
176402	179424	Sorry, there's no brakes.
179704	180604	Congratulations.
180624	181825	That's astonishing.
185225	188847	I think, realistically, we have to say the Lancia's won it.
189267	189948	Why?
190548	192009	By what possible measure?
192029	193570	No, you... It's the most surprising.
193810	194530	It's the worst.
194910	198152	No, well, you don't buy a second-hand car to be surprised that it still works.
198192	200033	It had to be rebuilt once a day.
200053	201614	Yeah, but you're right, it's rubbish.
202549	203810	Mercedes is the best car.
204610	204830	What?
205351	205951	What have I had to do?
205991	208212	I've had to change... Take the entire body off.
208393	209853	It's a showroom model, James.
210254	214436	All right, I admit that it's not entirely original, but in mechanical terms, it was perfect.
214456	215337	You cannot break it.
215976	221318	I think, honestly, we have to be magnanimous here, because only one of the cars has actually made it unmodified.
222239	225600	So, that brings us on to a Top Gear top tip.
225800	232624	If, people of Surrey, you want to replace your BMW X5 with something that's brilliant off-road... Simple.
232884	235885	Simple, inexpensive... Easy to maintain, surprisingly comfortable.
236085	236625	Absolutely.
237506	240027	Then you've got to get yourself a Volkswagen Beetle.
241687	241927	What?
242127	242588	It's true.
242608	243468	No, he's right.
243588	244008	It's true.
244028	244468	He's right.
245329	247850	You've replaced all the electrics in that car.
254833	263498	Tomorrow night at 8.50, it's more from the Top Gear lads with a Bolivia special as Jeremy, James and Richard are driving all the way to the coast of Chile from the heart of the jungle.
263818	266059	Let's hope they bring enough glove compartment snacks.
266399	268340	And up next, it's Sherlock on three.
