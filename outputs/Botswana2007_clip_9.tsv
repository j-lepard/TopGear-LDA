4433	6254	Look at that sun now, boys.
7035	10658	Elephants, rally special stage, best comb-over I've ever seen.
11138	11779	Everything's here.
25492	30238	We camped by the river, and while James serviced his car, I hatched a plan.
30578	30918	Jeremy.
32320	32620	Jeremy.
33441	33762	Jeremy.
34362	34743	Quick, come here.
35764	35984	Come here.
37005	37746	It's the cow's head.
37926	39729	Yeah, well, it wasn't working in the boat.
39909	40469	I've had a better idea.
40790	40930	What?
41210	41431	Ten.
42031	42392	His ten?
42532	42732	Yeah.
43032	43693	Love your thinking.
54831	55531	What's that?
55551	57451	It was a hippo.
58432	58692	What?
59692	59992	Plugs.
61012	63953	That sounded very close.
64253	67593	Oh, my God, look at that.
67613	72214	Hippos spend all day in water and then they come out at night because... I can't remember why.
73254	73834	Well, thank you.
73914	74434	That's useful.
74514	74974	Thank you.
76195	78475	Oh, brilliant.
78935	83236	Look, do you want to go out there with the hippopotamus?
84392	86833	Or do you want to stay in here where the horse is sat?
86853	87894	That's not a question that's ever been asked.
87914	88654	It's not a horse, either.
88694	90455	It's a cow.
91335	91655	Hang on.
92555	94136	That's my bag in James's tent.
94876	96037	This is my tent!
97438	98578	Oh, man, get it out!
101959	106141	Our starting point at the Zimbabwe border felt like it was in another time zone.
106581	112484	But still, there were many miles of delta to cover, and our cars were in a really bad way.
114778	124647	The bush mechanic we have on the team took two cubic feet of sand out of my carburettor last night and asked if I wouldn't mind driving a bit more slowly today.
127169	128029	James, he's coming!
130792	135096	Our ordinary second-hand road cars were getting more and more out of their depth.
135856	137538	This is proper off-roading now.
138976	145360	Men in camouflage trousers in Wales, who like murdering people at weekends, would say this was tough going.
145760	148281	It was a whole... Oh!
148742	149362	What is it?
149762	150563	It's like iron.
151523	154905	I think I've bent the steering back a bit.
156306	156746	Wow!
159108	160769	Wow, there is an elephant right there.
162410	163090	A door there.
165111	166332	That would stop an elephant.
169119	174167	Soon our route was blocked by a river and what you're supposed to do is wade in to check the depth.
176510	176991	Right.
178513	181337	Jeremy made us drive on until he got bored.
182118	182739	Here, now.
183809	184589	No.
185270	189951	I agree with him, for once, actually, because that reedy stuff must mean it's shallow.
190171	192812	It's shallow where the reeds are, you fool.
192832	194633	We'll just drive over to where the reeds are, then.
194653	196854	Yes, but you've got to drive through the water to get there.
197014	197834	We can't keep going.
197854	199115	We've done 30 miles.
199455	203036	No, I'm frustrated, but you can't just drive into a river because you're bored.
203456	207758	I do a fair bit of off-roading, and I know enough that that's not the place to go across.
207778	208138	You're wrong.
208278	209038	I'm going through here.
209058	210279	Are you going to carry on?
210899	213301	Yeah, well, I will carry on if you're going to go through there.
213841	214622	Keep your radio on.
214842	215062	All right.
215383	215743	I'm going.
217124	218725	I'm not doing a four-by-four.
219105	219866	Okay, so edging.
220086	220707	Fan belts off.
221307	222468	Fan belts off is a good idea.
222528	224249	Cos it'll splash water into the distributors.
224870	228072	James went first and I said I'd watch for crocodiles.
230174	231975	Ooh, I say there's a ground hornbill over there.
232296	233316	It's getting deeper.
233337	235018	Ooh, hang on a minute.
235378	236539	Permission to say cock.
237920	238721	It's coming in!
240441	242203	Thunderbird one to the rescue.
242223	244645	Come on, I'm sinking by the bows.
245205	245626	Coming.
250310	251071	No!
251531	252612	I can't help you.
252772	253373	Come on.
254073	256616	James, I'm in a low, slow sports car.
257056	258097	I'm going down.
260619	261260	That's good.
261780	262341	Yes!
262441	264483	I've got water coming into my car.
266982	269304	I've got a wet bottom!
269865	271447	We're through!
273209	277514	Both our cars were flooded, but our guides weren't bothered at all.
278215	283842	People of Surrey, if this happens to you, you get water in the footwell and you need to drain it out, you're going to need a hole.
283922	286085	Well, the people of Botswana have a tip for you.
299427	299951	Meanwhile...
