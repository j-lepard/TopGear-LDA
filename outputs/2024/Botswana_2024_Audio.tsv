63240	66422	Hello and welcome to our last ever Grand Tour.
67182	74707	And because this is the last time that James Richard and I will ever work together, Mr Wilman said we should do something important.
75507	84852	He said we should each buy a medium-sized electric car and then see how many laps of the M25 we could do in it on one charge.
86393	89415	And we decided to ignore him and come here.
104378	107662	Yes, so welcome everyone to Zimbabwe.
120803	123445	And we won't be driving crummy electric cars either.
123645	128868	Instead, the three of us decided that we would simply buy things we've always wanted.
129829	131130	And that's why I bought this.
131750	133872	It's a Triumph Stag.
156377	157558	I've always loved the Stag.
158038	160319	I've loved it since I was a small boy.
161019	162840	But I never actually thought I'd own one.
162900	165862	To be honest, I didn't think I was allowed to own one.
166222	169263	Only people like David Niven could own a Stag.
169844	173906	I'd never even driven one, in accordance with the rule that you should never meet your hero.
174366	178928	But now I have, I'm delighted to say, it's absolutely lovely.
178948	182170	Oh, yeah.
183306	187810	At this point, Lewis Collins arrived.
187910	190953	Oh, yeah.
192974	193735	Yep.
194536	198579	I am now the proud owner of a three-litre Mark I Ford Capri.
198599	200901	Is it a GT?
201102	202002	No, GXL.
202803	203784	Why didn't you get a GT?
203804	204765	Because this is better.
205465	206006	Not really.
206907	210450	Before I had a chance to argue, Clarkson arrived.
211144	213366	having already made a mistake.
220591	221752	Look at that!
222233	223774	Why have you bought a Lancia?
224354	231740	Because 20 or so years ago, I used one to drive across Botswana and proved it was the ideal car for Africa.
231760	233742	But it broke down all the time.
234554	238058	Yes, it did, but that was front engine.
238618	240160	This, mid-engined.
240200	241301	It's a Monte Carlo.
242002	245465	And I've made several modifications to suit the conditions.
245565	246786	Let me talk you through them, if I may.
247807	248909	At the back here...
250818	252519	308 Ferrari taillights.
252679	253160	They look good.
253540	254341	Quad tailpipes.
255161	255442	I see.
255702	264109	Delta Integrale wheels, Delta Integrale headlamps and grille, and then Lotus blue paintwork.
264750	265010	Wow.
265050	266591	Does any of that make it more reliable?
267232	271115	And, you know, we've been doing this for... 112 years.
271135	271615	Yeah, 112 years.
272236	273177	I've learned a few lessons.
273797	275319	So, inside...
276696	283382	I have replaced the leather seats, which get hot, with cloth seats and a sort of Alcantara racing steering wheel.
284303	293532	And, if you look down there, I've removed the glove box and replaced it with... Is that a fridge?
293572	293812	Yes.
294633	295573	For my cold beverages.
296428	298009	from a zesty drink fridge.
298349	299409	It is actually quite good.
299510	300930	Does any of that make you more reliable?
301030	302311	No, but I'll be more comfortable.
302331	304592	You will have a cold drink whilst you wait at the side of the road.
304612	306733	Yeah, it makes the many breakdowns more bearable.
306853	307754	No, it's pretty.
307874	309655	It is absolutely breathtaking.
309675	310275	Beautiful.
311616	313677	I've modified my Capri II before shipping it out.
313717	314017	Have you?
314257	317819	I have, as you can see, painted the bonnet black because... Look at it.
318719	319259	It's beautiful.
319660	320320	Is it a GT?
320500	321400	No, GXL.
322401	323261	Why didn't you get a GT?
323281	324202	Because this is better.
325300	325620	It isn't.
325881	326781	Well, it is.
327002	330965	It's like a GT, which is good, but with more, which is better.
333207	333427	What?
333947	338551	I remembered that from the GXL, because they put the wood look dashboard in it.
338611	339132	Correct.
339152	341053	I think we've discussed this in the past.
341114	342355	The GT is for sport.
342375	343736	The GXL is for meetings.
343936	344516	This is exactly right.
344536	346618	You need to understand your Ford badge hierarchy.
346638	350581	My dad had a GXL Cortina because he was a managing director.
350602	352203	My dad had a GXL Cortina.
352383	357805	Both of your dad's powerful, influential men who picked from the very top of the tree.
357925	361487	And you know how it's almost become a running joke?
361527	364748	My stereo has never worked on any one of these trips we've done.
364788	366048	Well, this time, it does.
370130	370470	Bear with.
370830	371510	Wait for the lyrics.
372611	373751	Used to be a DJ out in Deans.
374111	374572	Here they come.
375312	376532	Yes.
378473	379734	Not one for a Capri.
379914	380214	Voila.
383234	385256	I've got everything I need, which it has because it's a GXL.
385276	387599	I do like a Capri.
387779	388419	You've got to like it.
388459	389500	It's the law.
389761	390802	Everybody likes a Capri.
391322	393044	Modifications, James, do you stare?
393344	393565	None.
394766	395547	None whatsoever.
395627	397469	Wait a minute.
398169	400011	You're not telling me it's still got the original engine?
400452	400852	It has.
401173	403074	Mr Clarkson raises a good point there.
404201	412167	It's not every single stag, but most stags, I would guess, have had the original engine taken out and the Rover V8 put in.
412487	412727	Yes.
412827	413728	Which is more reliable.
414068	414249	Yeah.
414629	422915	The original Triumph Stag V8 is incredible because it's found so many ways of overheating and destroying itself, because it's not just one.
423636	427158	Casting sand left in the blocks fills the galleyways and then, bang, overheats.
427679	430861	They overboard it, they bored it out, which made all the waterways smaller.
431381	433142	So it overheats and goes black.
433363	440967	The clever thing is, two banks of cylinders, V8, they only put a temperature sender on one bank, so at least you don't know when it's overheated.
441147	449533	So if the other bank overheated, the first you'd know of it was the bank... If you're on an aeroplane, being piloted directly at some mountains, do you want to know?
450173	450994	Actually, probably not.
451054	451914	Why would you want to know?
452174	455196	You're having your gin and tonic, watching a movie, having a nice time.
455677	455937	Nothing.
456803	461728	I don't want to raise... I don't want to raise that submarine, because that's sick, but they didn't know.
461908	463329	Hey, this is the last break of refugee.
463649	464891	We don't give a f*** anymore.
465431	470075	How much solace did we take from the fact that they didn't know it was... Oh, we're having a nice time under the sea... Bam!
470276	470876	Yeah, exactly.
471437	471917	You couldn't write.
472638	477703	Call us by all means to complain, but you'll get a recorded message saying, we are not interested in your call.
477883	479004	Or simply dial 0800-BUGGER-OFF.
480367	481388	We're not here anymore.
481408	482368	We're not even there.
483809	484929	We can say whatever we want.
485409	486610	How do you open the bonnet on this?
487130	488131	Around this side.
488151	490352	Get the wear on that handle.
490412	493473	It's worn the badge off with the picture of a bonnet opening.
493513	494194	Pull it from the middle.
494934	496895	Shit, it is the original Triumph engine.
496915	497796	That's a rarity.
497816	501718	All right, ladies and gentlemen, come and have a look, because it's the last time you're going to see that.
501978	504179	Original, but still shit.
504199	505319	Oh, what?
506260	506540	Text.
508727	509533	Oh, it's Mr. Wilman.
510138	510238	Oh.
510581	510883	Oh, Lord.
516986	520809	Now that you've charged your electric cars, you will report to South MIMS Services.
527353	532156	It doesn't matter anyway, because we've already worked out a challenge on our own.
532877	542023	We are currently on the far eastern side of Zimbabwe, and we're going to travel 1,200 miles to the far western side.
543263	543844	And that's it.
545229	545689	That's it!
546070	547631	Just one thing still concerns me.
547911	549232	Mountains?
549592	549992	All that?
550292	560699	Well, I'm not worried, because this, let's not forget, this spawned the 037 Lancia, which was the last two-wheel-drive car to win the World Rally Championship, beating the Alicantro.
560719	562580	There wasn't a lot of that in it, was there?
563141	572127	Well... What they actually did was they said, we can make this the basis of a fantastic rally car with a few modifications, and they cut the badge off there, and then everything from there backwards was new.
574727	583592	With no further ado, we've fired up our 50-year-old sports cars and set off to cross the rugged heart of Africa.
583612	589995	So, for the last time... Here we go.
604770	608052	I work all my life without will to win you.
608472	610974	I stand naked, stoned, and stabbed.
610994	619940	I call that a bargain, the best I ever had.
628291	632673	This is the perfect car for me to take on this trip.
633133	636334	My first car was nearly a Capri.
637555	638995	It was advertised in the local paper.
639035	643777	I kept the picture of it next to the till in the petrol station where I worked in Ripon.
644837	645598	I was just coming on 18.
645678	647418	It was going to be my first car.
647458	648779	My parents were buying it for me.
648839	652340	But when we inspected it, it turned out to have been stolen.
653061	654521	So I got an old 1976 Toyota Corolla instead.
657500	660023	For a trip like this, this car's perfect.
660123	663586	It's light, just a shade over a metric tonne.
664247	665468	Plenty of grunt and power.
666749	673016	Three-litre SXV6 up front, rear-wheel drive, brakes... That's it.
674198	675519	I love that the rev counter says 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.
675719	678762	It doesn't work, but if it did, you'd see it indicated in thousands.
678782	679322	That sounds better.
698314	703137	Back in the 80s, I never used to drive into central London on the M4 motorway.
703497	707279	I always used the old Great West Road instead.
707999	716624	Because on the Great West Road, there was a car dealership called the Checkered Flag, and sometimes, in the window, they'd have a Monte Carlo.
717864	723928	And if there was one, I'd pull over and stare at it for hours, dreaming.
725748	726529	And now I'm in one.
728117	728877	And it's mine.
730638	735780	Mine!
736040	740161	As for me, I had just one thing to say.
742422	743902	Triumph Stag.
749704	751945	Holy moly, look at that view!
759594	764417	I don't know what it is, but something is making me want a cup of tea.
773664	774424	What's that about?
774504	777526	Oh, you're joking.
778707	781589	Chaps, no other way to put this other than I'm breaking down.
782930	783410	I'm sorry?
784371	785872	Oh, this is exciting.
791118	796362	It's extraordinary because the Capri has the same number of moving parts as this bottle of water.
796382	800926	How can you possibly break down in a Capri?
802467	803428	Oh, I know what that is.
804829	805690	The engine's not working.
806030	807231	I think it's the engine as well.
807711	808512	And we're experts.
809033	810854	Mine was the first bonnet to go up.
811795	813216	What would we do in this situation?
813496	814097	Well, let's think.
814457	815458	What would we normally do?
816398	816479	Oh...
817188	817848	Lean on the car.
817969	818629	That's very hot.
818689	822131	Should we change the habit of a lifetime and help him?
822211	823492	Yes, for once.
823692	824573	I'm going to say no.
828755	829075	Bye.
830016	832057	Still a bastard after all these years.
838121	840222	Right.
840242	841082	15 miles, we've done.
842203	843404	And we're down to two men.
845125	845285	Oh!
846146	846586	One thing.
848266	852009	It's not just the Ford that has its own music.
853330	854331	This does as well.
855912	860116	Time, I think, to treat myself to a little bit of Struggle Jennings and Monte Carlo.
860196	860897	Here we go.
861997	872006	Some young souls on a lonely road Had no fathers to follow Monte Carlo
879828	884349	A few miles later, though, a new instrument joined in with the rhythm section.
884969	886650	And it wasn't very rhythmical.
886670	893211	There's fire there.
893291	893771	There's fire.
893791	903973	There's fire, there's fire.
903993	904253	Cows.
910578	911819	This is just shit.
913340	915602	There's a big puff of smoke coming from your car.
916523	918304	Oh, Christ almighty.
920066	920426	Yeah.
922507	923168	It's about fire.
926070	926771	It's the engine.
927251	927752	Yeah.
929093	929553	Yeah.
929893	936679	I'd love to help, but I don't know much about the Italian twin-cam engines, and mine is working perfectly.
940131	942333	If you break down, who's going to leave you behind?
942393	943694	Well, that's my biggest worry.
944695	946056	I'll have to leave myself behind.
946076	953562	Temperatures and pressures good.
958866	963910	Only one car is still going a full 32 miles into the journey.
965692	966332	Stag.
969051	974393	Several miles back, I'd managed to work out that the Capri's issue was the fuel pump.
975714	976834	Slight problem here.
977715	983877	I've never seen inside one of these when it is working to know how it should look and how it should compare with when it isn't.
992260	998463	Meanwhile, I'd deployed my genius and already worked out how to solve the Lancia's problem.
999875	1001956	This thing on the end was loose.
1002816	1015601	If I tighten that up, that'll spark properly and the misfire will go away and the unburnt fuel will stop getting into the exhaust pipe and catching fire and setting fire to my Lancia.
1022023	1022663	Ticking, Sam.
1022703	1023484	What's that ticking?
1034460	1038862	As I'm used to being electrocuted these days, I'll use my genius again.
1039582	1041283	Replace the HT leads.
1044044	1045485	Soon I was underway.
1049146	1050707	Oh, she purrs like a kitten.
1058931	1068476	I set off in pursuit of James, not sure which was more surprising, the quality of the road or the endlessly changing scenery.
1072338	1076100	These are pine trees in Africa.
1076140	1082303	You were literally on a tea plantation and now there are pine trees.
1084184	1087667	Someone beamed me here into there and said, where are you in the world?
1087707	1089008	He'd say, well, Scotland.
1093991	1098314	By the time I caught up with James... James May!
1098675	1104939	...he was in the foothills of the mountains, where the lovely road soon became a dirt track.
1106740	1108582	Well, I knew that was too good to last.
1110163	1111164	Dust, dust.
1114297	1114757	Argh!
1115778	1117658	My mouth is filling with dust.
1118318	1124200	But then I remembered that for the first time ever, we were in control of our destiny.
1127261	1127641	Stop.
1127741	1128542	Stop whenever we want.
1128582	1129562	Mr Wilman's not here.
1129702	1130042	Brilliant.
1131183	1133743	No point driving beyond... Well, it's four o'clock now.
1136144	1139225	A few miles later, we saw a sign to some lodgings.
1139865	1141026	Dropped Hammond a pin,
1142088	1143830	and decided to knock off for the day.
1143850	1148016	I don't imagine this'll be the best hotel in the world.
1148076	1158909	I mean, we're in the middle of Zimbabwe, in the middle of a forest, on top of a mountain, but, you know... Thankfully, I was wrong.
1160091	1160792	Very wrong.
1167856	1169338	It's even a perfect temperature, isn't it?
1171861	1173222	It's pretty special, isn't it?
1173382	1176065	You see those mountains there, the far ones, that's Mozambique.
1178568	1181311	There was always a reason why we couldn't come to Zimbabwe.
1182042	1185864	Well, those years we were at the BBC, we couldn't come here because the BBC was banned.
1186344	1186544	Yeah.
1187305	1193928	If you think about today, got up in a very agreeable place, drove on a very agreeable road... Yep.
1194248	1195889	..to a very agreeable hotel.
1196289	1198210	It's better than Mr Wilman's idea, isn't it?
1198790	1200531	Why have we listened to him all these years?
1200551	1201091	I don't know.
1201671	1206454	Although he will argue that without his presence, two of the cars went wrong within the first 25 miles.
1207634	1210856	That then got us nuttering about our car's stats.
1211878	1213418	I was quite surprised how much we paid.
1214979	1216639	You paid, James May, as I'm sure you know, £26,500.
1216679	1217299	I did.
1217319	1225061	Richard Hammond, for his GXL, the wrong Capri, £25,000.
1225721	1226101	Really?
1226121	1227601	£25,000 for a GXL.
1227841	1228842	For a knackered Capri.
1229162	1229802	Monte Carlo, £17,950.
1232302	1232742	Bargain.
1233282	1234203	That is a bargain.
1235163	1237843	Ours are 0-60 and give or take nine seconds.
1237883	1239224	Hammond's give or take eight seconds.
1239984	1240784	Well, not at the moment.
1241485	1241725	No.
1243226	1245666	Happily, I was now on the move.
1246047	1252049	But on the dirt road, I was starting to worry that the Capri hadn't been the wisest choice.
1253649	1258311	That was a bit groundy-outy.
1260291	1261892	With hindsight...
1263166	1272916	I should have gone for something with better ground clearance than a 1974 3-litre Ford Capri Mk1 GXL.
1274757	1277100	And that would include pretty much anything, as it turns out.
1277120	1280403	I think it's time for me to just clear the windscreen a bit.
1282805	1282945	Oh.
1284126	1284827	Oh, no, that... Oh.
1296463	1298344	I've just removed my exhaust.
1302707	1305229	There is literally nothing I can do about that right now.
1309633	1314296	Predictably, when I finally arrived, my colleagues were brimming with sympathy.
1316037	1317398	We stopped work at four o'clock.
1317819	1318139	Did you?
1318259	1318399	Yeah.
1318479	1320300	In the sunshine at four o'clock.
1320320	1321261	It was quite warm then.
1321441	1322382	We've had eight of these.
1323592	1324433	Can I have one of those?
1324553	1326534	They've just run out.
1326855	1328016	Have they?
1328056	1328856	Have they?
1329016	1329957	He's gone to the shops.
1329977	1347432	Unfortunately, they're 30 miles... After not having a beer, Hammond ruined the nocturnal African soundtrack by noisily sorting out his exhaust.
1357108	1363973	And the next morning, James ruined the dawn chorus by turning into Mrs Overall.
1368936	1369457	Morning.
1370117	1370498	Morning.
1371658	1379004	How empty does your mind have to be for you to think, I could look at the view and listen to the birdsong, but instead I'm going to vacuum my car.
1379024	1383527	I've been up for four hours, looked at the view and listened to the birdsong, and now I've made this thing of beauty more beautiful.
1383567	1384447	Oh, hang on, sorry.
1386109	1386549	Guess what?
1387921	1388942	Text from Mr Wilman.
1389582	1389762	Go on.
1389822	1392864	I've always crossed.
1393464	1394125	Has he rumbled us?
1394365	1394885	I think so.
1395165	1395526	Right.
1396166	1399948	I've just found out you've taken three classic cars to Zimbabwe.
1400989	1404911	And as it's fairly certain one of them will break down... What do you have?
1406232	1409794	I've asked my local contacts to send you a backup car.
1410535	1410855	Really?
1417148	1417589	Got to be.
1418209	1419451	Oh, yeah.
1420833	1421534	Oh, God.
1422154	1424718	Oh, shit.
1426280	1427181	This is awful.
1427561	1427761	Is it?
1427842	1429684	I haven't seen one for years, actually.
1429764	1430104	It is.
1430405	1431466	It's a vase.
1431927	1432908	Oh, I forgot about the vase.
1432928	1435611	You're supposed to put a little flower in it because you're a hippie.
1436462	1439563	Well, I tell you what, you know that little village just come five miles back?
1439803	1440043	Yeah.
1440504	1443705	Why don't I take this into the village and I'll sell it or give it away?
1443765	1444265	I'll get rid of it.
1444305	1445005	Yes, get rid.
1445025	1446486	Do you want something to put over your head?
1449767	1451448	It's the definition of hateful.
1453548	1457190	Just round the corner, though, things went terribly wrong.
1464229	1466512	Hammond, I am in a right old pickle here.
1466612	1467133	What's happened?
1468354	1471598	I've had the most extraordinary accident, OK?
1471638	1474682	I lost it and I've ended up here on this cliff edge.
1475763	1476023	Look.
1477064	1477445	Oh, yeah.
1478211	1478891	It gets worse.
1479691	1481792	A brick is now on the accelerator.
1481812	1483112	The engine's screaming away.
1483172	1489754	It's in gear, it's in first, and there's a brum handle holding the clutch pedal down because it's wedged against the seat.
1489874	1491135	Wait, so everything's okay?
1491295	1498977	Well, yes, except somehow, God knows where it came from, a bit of rope has attached itself at one end
1500526	1503689	to the brum handle and at the other end to that dog.
1504389	1504970	Jesus!
1505330	1514077	Now, at the moment, the situation is stable, but over there, as you can see, James May is opening a tin of dog food.
1515659	1521984	Now, if the dog sees that, we're in a world of trouble, and I just don't know what to do.
1522504	1523906	I can't think of a solution.
1526168	1526388	Wait.
1527369	1528309	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1528329	1528830	I've got a plan.
1532222	1532864	No, it won't work.
1534168	1535091	Have you got anything?
1536074	1536997	I've got nothing.
1537017	1539946	You don't notice change, do you?
1581124	1594392	Still coming, isn't it?
1594432	1596333	Still coming.
1597334	1602937	I think it's finished.
1604238	1605419	That was quite a big accident.
1605839	1606619	Well, look at it this way.
1607440	1609021	At least Mr Wilman now has his trailer.
1613110	1616551	We didn't need Mr Wilman's wretched backup car anyway.
1617932	1619772	Because we'd brought our own.
1621353	1626694	And here it is, a Rover SD1 Vandem Plus EFI.
1626714	1629195	190 horsepower of golden glory.
1629515	1632076	It is golden glory, and it's golden glory everywhere.
1632456	1633096	Oh, it is, yes.
1633136	1635917	Whoever re-sprayed this did a magnificent job.
1636457	1639721	You didn't just spray the body, even the aerial there.
1640081	1643685	I have covered this car, but it is still magnificent.
1643765	1646709	It's the only time we've had a back-up car that we'd like to be in.
1646729	1647370	We all might.
1647430	1648851	My grandfather had one of these.
1648891	1649953	Yeah, my dad had one too.
1650133	1657101	There was one of them in one drive on the suburban street in Birmingham where I grew up, and we would go silent as we walked past it out of respect.
1657621	1668495	And the really good thing is, from your point of view, the engine from this, as we know, because almost every stag owner in the world has already done it, fits perfectly into your car.
1668736	1672260	Can I suggest a modification that you and I, Jeremy, make to this car?
1672441	1673963	A little padlock on the bonnet.
1675529	1678651	We'll have the key when you need the engine, which you will, ask.
1678671	1681753	Or we could find the man who did this bit of welding... That's beautiful.
1681873	1682874	Oh, that's good, isn't it?
1682994	1684195	...and weld the bonnet shut.
1684215	1685456	Actually, that's probably the factory.
1686236	1688978	It probably came out of Longbridge.
1688998	1690859	I think we've got a finished set now.
1690879	1691579	That's lovely.
1691600	1692140	You can't see it.
1692180	1692440	Look.
1692560	1692780	Gone.
1695262	1703147	With golden glory taking up the rear, we set off west once more in our quest to get over the mountains.
1716946	1717446	Hey, look at this.
1717466	1722589	These are road repair people, but they're having an impromptu sort of dance club thing.
1724190	1728693	I wish road workers back at home did that, but I suppose they'd have to be there to start with, wouldn't they?
1739366	1748651	Having done a bit of paddling, we started to climb, and the incredible Zimbabwean landscape changed once again.
1748671	1751973	Look at those meadows.
1751993	1754134	You'd expect to see cows with bells on them.
1755035	1758717	And Julie Andrews giving it doe a deer and all the rest of it.
1759917	1764220	So we've done tea plantation, and now we're in Austria.
1769949	1771870	Then it changed again.
1773351	1777014	Well, hold on a minute.
1777034	1784399	To my right, the most spectacular valley I've ever seen in my life.
1784419	1787321	To my left, Ireland.
1787361	1794727	I know what happened.
1796334	1800516	God had done all the other countries in the world, and he got to the end of the alphabet.
1800536	1807620	He got to Z, got to Zimbabwe, and he thought, right, this is going to be my best work.
1808080	1810322	This is going to be my greatest hit.
1811322	1815464	You've got the all-star tiny dancer, Benny and the Jets.
1816685	1817526	It's stunning.
1819267	1821748	And it just changes all the time.
1825849	1833655	Sadly, in my low-slung Capri, I couldn't look at the view because I was too busy looking at the road surface.
1833675	1845084	They didn't drive Capris this way in the professionals, as I recall.
1845845	1847306	It was all a bit more lively.
1852310	1852870	I enjoy this.
1852890	1853391	It's fun.
1853431	1855512	You know, that's what I want to do.
1855852	1859014	Oh, my God, look at that one.
1860695	1867219	I was suffering none of Hammond's problems because my little Lancia had been a sensible choice.
1869821	1877446	This really is the ideal car for rough-road African exploration because the engine is behind me.
1878433	1879994	So there's no prop shaft.
1880554	1881535	There are no exhausts.
1881635	1885196	There's nothing to snack on the road surface.
1887317	1895581	I could therefore push on at a respectable leg... until something did snack on the road surface.
1913803	1914684	What is that?
1918568	1919669	These are bits of lancia.
1920590	1921911	Oh, joy!
1927296	1927757	Thank you.
1927977	1928337	Thank you.
1928397	1929078	I needed that.
1929719	1930519	I do need that.
1931580	1931961	Thank you.
1933875	1933995	Oh.
1935136	1936276	Do you not want it to go down the front?
1936296	1937877	There's nothing to see at the front of my car.
1937897	1939538	Because there's no front of your car!
1939818	1944240	But this is all I need, with a bit of super glue, because we're tenting tonight.
1944440	1947822	Nothing to do when you're tenting other than glue your car back together again.
1951103	1952564	We continued onwards.
1955982	1958505	Wow, that was a thumb-breaker.
1959125	1963089	And then, once again, we stopped continuing onwards.
1964390	1966793	Oh, no.
1969936	1971437	I think my exhaust has come off again.
1973639	1975121	Having a spot of bother, sir.
1978536	1980578	That is an extended exhaust system.
1981079	1981479	That's weird.
1981519	1981980	Very low.
1982020	1984222	I think you'll catch that on the ground if you're not careful.
1985103	1988326	Why can't you just drive up the road like the rest of us are?
1988506	1989888	I can't drive with it like that.
1990428	1991449	I need to remove it.
1991990	1993171	Have you played your Capri music?
1993191	1993952	Will that cheer you up?
1994312	1996595	Mark Warnford, Capri!
1996675	2000278	It's got everything I need except the exhaust pipe.
2001952	2004756	I need, I'm going to say, an 11-mil spanner.
2005256	2006137	Ooh, now, hang on.
2006458	2009561	I've got some antibiotics for something I don't have anymore.
2009601	2010923	I don't think... I've got this, Hammond.
2011844	2013646	Bernie Taupin's autobiography.
2013827	2014848	I've heard that's really good.
2015048	2015469	Very good.
2015529	2016109	I'm reading it.
2016129	2017311	Would that help you?
2017351	2019033	No, I don't think it would actually help, no.
2019313	2020555	I'm going to say 11 again, 11-mil spanner.
2025899	2030180	What's particularly irritating is this car was in brilliant condition when I bought it.
2030400	2031701	I mean, genuinely.
2032001	2032901	So was that Rimac.
2035322	2035962	Low blow.
2035982	2040323	That was a bit harsh, but I can't deny it's true.
2040683	2042284	It was, yeah, until then.
2045085	2050086	Eager to reach the top of the mountain before nightfall, we left our colleague behind.
2050106	2055368	Honestly, if Richard Hammond was a block of flats, he'd be condemned.
2062751	2069634	Further ahead, the climb was starting to get so tough, you'd think twice about taking a Land Rover up it.
2070355	2073456	Leave alone a brittle Italian sports car.
2074637	2076638	Oh, God, bloody stone there.
2077879	2079359	We started at 6,000 feet.
2079399	2085562	We must be pushing 7,000, 8,000 now.
2085622	2087463	I can't even get it into second.
2088264	2089144	It's so steep.
2090445	2090525	Oh!
2092110	2104835	I mean, the fact of the matter is, if you drive relentlessly uphill in first gear at the beginning of the African summer, a car is likely to overheat, and it is, though.
2117365	2119446	Right, I fixed it.
2119926	2123308	Well, when I say fixed, quite a lot of it, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
2128831	2130392	We're back on the road now, Essex.
2131292	2132033	Let's go.
2134274	2134454	Ooh.
2137115	2138316	Get into camp this evening.
2139217	2141298	We can have a nice old session, put me a ride.
2145014	2154561	Whilst Hammond was missing another sunset, James and I reached the summit of the mountain and decided, yet again, that we'd had enough for the day.
2154581	2156643	Cheers.
2157063	2157403	Cheers.
2157423	2160546	That's nice.
2161787	2168292	And after enjoying a refreshing golden hour beer, I set about reassembling the Lancia's face.
2175902	2178523	This is like watching a dog try to learn a card trick.
2180264	2183225	Little bit of glue and this is literally as good as new.
2185086	2190648	By the time Hammond reached our campsite, it was completely dark.
2190668	2197791	This is the most woeful arrival.
2205665	2206105	22 years.
2206126	2208008	You'd think we'd know how to do it, but no.
2208989	2209650	Here he comes.
2211071	2212553	With one and a half headlamps.
2213013	2213935	Essex is here!
2213955	2218420	Hammond, however, wasn't the only one having problems.
2219341	2220862	Were you having a nice moment?
2221550	2223350	Well, I'm not having a very nice moment.
2223430	2225231	No, he's glued his finger to the table.
2225251	2227571	I've glued myself to the table with super glue.
2228531	2231292	How do you drive a Lancia Monte Carlo when you've got a table glued to your finger?
2231332	2232012	Are you going to glue it?
2232232	2232952	Oh, I see.
2233292	2236533	You could slide a razor blade between your finger and the table.
2236553	2237373	It's a bit risky.
2237633	2237913	Can you?
2238233	2239693	Yeah, but very carefully.
2239713	2241074	Would you like me to do it for you?
2241194	2243154	James, he's glued the tip of his finger.
2243314	2244554	No, the fingerprint.
2244674	2245054	The pad.
2245234	2247635	So you only need to... If you cut it at the first joint,
2248717	2249057	Thank you.
2249197	2249457	Hammond?
2250037	2250997	Have I misunderstood?
2251158	2252958	Then we could graft a biro onto it.
2253758	2254778	Then he'd always have a pen.
2254958	2257679	A bottle opener.
2257779	2260700	I'm not listening to you.
2261020	2262280	I'm not listening.
2262480	2264080	Replace it with a corkscrew.
2264180	2265200	Opener-o-knuckle.
2265320	2267521	Oh, brilliant.
2267601	2271502	It's the first time I've ever glued anything to anything.
2271542	2272142	Successfully.
2272722	2273422	I'll get this off.
2273923	2274983	Can we just cut, please?
2275584	2276204	Yeah, I can cut.
2277104	2277224	Ooh!
2277585	2278245	I'm interested.
2278265	2279085	Give me that.
2279566	2280846	It's Mark Sandman's new knife.
2280906	2283327	He's very, very proud of it.
2283347	2284388	Yes, I'm not interested in it.
2284408	2285629	It's incredibly sharp.
2285649	2285889	Good.
2286669	2287590	How sharp is... Ooh!
2287710	2289150	Ooh, yes, it's... Ooh, it is.
2289170	2290351	Ooh, it is.
2290951	2291692	Aha!
2291732	2292492	This is working.
2293433	2296074	Do we look like one of those Dutch paintings with businessmen in big hats?
2298248	2298948	It's working.
2299288	2300008	It's working.
2300589	2301529	This is in the trailer.
2301849	2303169	This is definitely in the trailer.
2303249	2304009	Look at that!
2304029	2305109	Yes, there you go.
2305129	2307610	A grown man unglued his fingers.
2307630	2310191	Mark, I've glued your knife to the table.
2322313	2326174	The next morning, after a terrible and cold night under canvas,
2327168	2329950	I proudly showed off my workmanship.
2330991	2333112	Look how well I've done the job I've done.
2334593	2336814	I thought you'd got a new part from a shop.
2337275	2338195	Where is the repair?
2338796	2341638	The brackets that hold it on are brokered.
2342858	2349723	So I need to find some place where I can buy basically new brackets and bolts and things to get it fastened back on again.
2362458	2366160	I feel I ought to apologise, really, viewers, for having a slightly boring car.
2366661	2372204	The others spend their evenings putting exhaust pipes back on, making a jigsaw puzzle out of the front bumper.
2372244	2374105	All I can really do is give mine a bit of a clean.
2377027	2380049	Still, at least we were now going downhill.
2382791	2385853	And soon, things got even better.
2388134	2388735	Oh, yes.
2389875	2390496	Look at this.
2391676	2392236	Look at it.
2393797	2395657	Oh, there is a God.
2398198	2399858	And God has provided tarmac.
2404340	2408541	It's good because now we're on a road, we can actually look at... Why did my windscreen wipers go on then?
2411722	2418024	What this meant is we'd crossed the Irish Alps and entered actual Africa.
2423220	2425841	It's completely changed again, the terrain.
2426841	2427502	Look at that.
2428702	2429922	Jeez, it's wet.
2429982	2430603	It's pretty.
2433704	2435344	We're on a Star Trek set now.
2435384	2437625	Oh, look at that occasion with the red flowers.
2441146	2443687	And then we saw something even better.
2445088	2445648	Ooh!
2447309	2448529	I love a scrapyard.
2452315	2455677	We pulled in to see if they had the spare parts we needed.
2456578	2459780	But soon we were distracted by all the treasures.
2461562	2464604	This is a very good test of our motoring knowledge.
2465885	2467286	Is that a Cresta behind that?
2467566	2468167	I think it is.
2468227	2469928	A Cresta shooting brake.
2470048	2470889	Shooting brake?
2471169	2472610	As my mother always used to call them.
2475396	2477057	In what special did you drive one of these?
2477718	2478018	Bolivia.
2478038	2478218	Yeah!
2478679	2480980	He's remembered something.
2481521	2484323	That genuinely is worth restoring.
2484743	2485484	It's gorgeous.
2485504	2486124	Hey, look at this one.
2486545	2487606	That's an Austin Cambridge.
2487666	2489567	It is indeed an Austin Cambridge.
2489627	2490188	With writing.
2490208	2490668	What's that?
2491028	2491469	RSR.
2491829	2494391	That means it was when this was Rhodesia.
2494711	2497974	That's... Oh, is that what it said?
2497994	2499615	That's been off the road a long time.
2499735	2500616	That's been there a while.
2500956	2501476	Excuse me.
2501717	2502877	Are you trying to make this go?
2503820	2504100	Yes.
2504460	2504961	Nearly there.
2506702	2507262	Good luck.
2508202	2510023	Yeah, yeah, nearly there.
2510464	2511304	You may think it's a joke.
2511884	2519469	Best-selling car in Zimbabwe in the sort of 60s was... Where do they whisk French?
2520706	2522468	Renault 4.
2522528	2524429	Renault 4.
2524789	2527492	Do you know what the fifth best-selling car was?
2527512	2528692	The Lancia Monte Carlo?
2529013	2529333	Close.
2529713	2530794	I bet it was an Alfa Romeo.
2530854	2532015	Alfa Romeo Giulia.
2533296	2535057	They made them in South Africa.
2535138	2543844	A friend of mine's dad ran the Ford factory in Harare, and they used to smuggle parts of Alfa's out of South Africa.
2544665	2547628	and then build Alfas in the Ford factory and sell them.
2547808	2548448	As Alfas?
2548668	2549549	Yeah, as Alfas.
2549769	2555114	But they also used to build them in the... But there were Alfa Romeos running around here that Alfa Romeo didn't know they'd built.
2555134	2556195	The VIN numbers will be wrong.
2556595	2557816	The VIN numbers?
2557836	2570026	Stop just saying... Annoyingly, the scrapyard didn't have any bumper mounts for a Lancia Monte Carlo or exhaust brackets for a 1974 Capri GXL.
2575137	2580785	So, Hammond decided to bodge another repair while I took the roof off my Monte Carlo.
2580805	2584591	The aircon is just useless and I'm being pushed.
2584771	2587294	Honestly, it's like being in the black hole of Calcutta in there.
2587595	2588176	Can't say that.
2591619	2592080	Why not?
2592480	2593241	I just don't think you can.
2593281	2596945	All right, if you object to me saying the black hole of Calcutta... I don't object.
2597005	2598026	I'm just saying... No, I'm not you.
2598086	2599607	I'm talking to the ladies and gentlemen at home.
2599627	2603431	If anybody wants to write in and say they object to that, you go right ahead.
2603672	2604112	I'm gone.
2604152	2604553	I'm done.
2605173	2606455	Can you just pull the lever again?
2606475	2607716	Dial... It's 0800 off sod.
2610598	2611178	Off sod.
2611719	2615380	And then you'll get a recorded message saying, we do not value your call.
2615400	2616980	Yes, your call is not important to us.
2617040	2621382	Your call... Just pull the lever again, cos there's another little latch bit here.
2621742	2621982	Here?
2622282	2622522	Yeah.
2622922	2623102	Look!
2623402	2624082	Yes, there you go.
2624102	2625523	The whole thing is disintegrated.
2626203	2628284	How did you make... And then what happens?
2629564	2636086	Well, I think... Why does that bit... That doesn't... Yeah, but how does that...?
2639755	2641176	Well, why does that bit unlatch then?
2641617	2642978	Do these now just... Oh, wait.
2643959	2646041	If that goes... You think this goes under?
2646502	2646922	Might do.
2648283	2648784	Like that?
2649124	2649325	Yes.
2649385	2650446	Well, stop it... Oh, I see.
2650806	2651046	Oh.
2651867	2651947	Ah.
2652227	2652688	Yeah.
2652728	2652908	No.
2653008	2653188	No.
2653609	2654209	But nearly.
2654750	2655451	But possibly.
2655471	2659615	There you go.
2659715	2660135	You think that's...
2663965	2669347	And in just 24 minutes, we've converted the Lancia Monte Carlo into a convertible.
2669387	2670647	James, thank you for your help.
2672428	2674808	We then had a gossip about our colleague.
2676189	2681911	Captain Exhaust Pipe is going to attempt, apparently, to put straight-through exhausts... Oh, really?
2681951	2685732	...out of the side of the car, so we'll have basically, like, stacks like a Kenworth truck.
2686612	2688013	Well, I've got a suggestion.
2688353	2689093	We leave him behind.
2689113	2689773	Yes, exactly.
2689793	2692194	I also don't like people with tattoos.
2694855	2695716	They're fully grown men.
2695776	2697137	They've drawn themselves.
2697637	2701519	It's the name of his programme he does on The Smallest Cock.
2701559	2704201	He's had his television... What happens when that gets canned?
2704801	2707323	I mean, what if I'd had Top Gear tattooed on my arm?
2707343	2707663	Yes, exactly.
2708083	2713386	You'll have to cross it out and write, I'm appearing as Buttons at Swindon Wyvern, which he will be one day.
2716248	2716888	I'm Buttons.
2716908	2718089	Maybe just Buttons, yeah.
2718950	2719970	Let's put it there, really.
2724384	2728125	After this, the ghosts of Christmas future set off.
2728145	2729385	See you, Hammond.
2729586	2729946	Yeah.
2730806	2731266	Bye.
2732466	2733307	Happy travels.
2742029	2750732	While Hammond banged and clanged away, James and I headed towards the capital city of Harare.
2750952	2752092	Manicalo.
2760864	2762388	And now we were on tarmac.
2763290	2765153	We made good time getting there.
2781803	2784104	I'm gonna miss driving through cities like this.
2785064	2786704	God, they're colourful and fun.
2787924	2789185	Check out the policeman, James.
2789265	2790705	Check out that policeman.
2791225	2797547	He's magnificent!
2798607	2801148	Is he having any effect at all on the traffic?
2801948	2805489	No, but he cheers everybody up immensely.
2808124	2811646	As we headed for the city centre, we came across a market.
2812526	2813226	A big one.
2815968	2817568	Jesus, this is enormous!
2817789	2821490	Okay... And soon, I had an idea.
2836912	2845455	Right, as this is the last time we ever work together, shall we see if we can help Richard Hammond and see if we can actually buy him an exhaust pipe for his car?
2846375	2847315	Yeah, OK, why not?
2848196	2852797	To speed up the shopping, I fired up another modification.
2852817	2854918	My on-board public address system.
2857299	2860720	Does anybody have an exhaust system for a Ford Capri?
2862518	2864959	Mark 1 3-litre GXL.
2865699	2867280	On the left, exhaust systems.
2868240	2868680	Oh, yes.
2869380	2872481	Do you think any of them will fit a Mark 1 V6 GXL?
2873362	2875883	I expect they'll fit as well as the ones that are currently on there.
2879344	2886986	And on that point, many miles back... Like a glove.
2891946	2892788	Sidewinder.
2893550	2894011	Yeah.
2899002	2900084	That sounds even better.
2920578	2923659	We were now on foot as we searched for an exhaust.
2925120	2926200	Shock absorber shop, look.
2927281	2928261	Shocks and springs.
2929942	2930542	Tail lights.
2930582	2933904	Huh?
2933944	2939266	Oh, shit, it's covered in paper.
2939346	2939686	Oh, wow.
2944946	2946648	We are literally front-page news.
2947608	2948709	Top Gear legends.
2949790	2950271	There, look.
2950691	2951452	Here we are again.
2953494	2954254	You see, they've got it here.
2954294	2958018	Superstars who made their name at Top Gear and then blew it.
2959098	2962381	The most recognisable figures in the world when it comes to motoring on television.
2963182	2964263	That's a narrow band.
2964523	2965104	Yeah, there's a bit.
2968752	2970033	Look, this is getting more promising.
2970973	2976956	I think it's fair to say that if our colleague had known we were exhaust shopping, he'd have been very grateful.
2976976	2986100	Okay, I'll be honest.
2986160	2986981	Had enough now.
2996377	3001522	Darkness had fallen by the time I arrived at our peaceful boutique hotel.
3013694	3014174	Chaps!
3015255	3016817	Have you had a rotten day?
3016837	3018519	I've got your beer.
3018599	3020701	But I think more important than that...
3023536	3025157	And yes, it is a correct set.
3025397	3025637	Look.
3025757	3026858	For the GXL.
3027278	3029139	It is for the GXL, not the GT.
3029439	3030960	If this is a cruel joke... No.
3031460	3031921	Really?
3032241	3032441	Yeah.
3033081	3033802	Oh, my God!
3034962	3035883	Look what that means!
3036463	3037103	Feel that.
3037183	3037624	Quiet!
3038084	3039565	It means you're getting no sleep tonight.
3040025	3040885	Oh, I don't care!
3040905	3042706	Hammond, it doesn't stop there.
3043026	3043307	What?
3043327	3044327	It doesn't stop there.
3044347	3046728	This is embarrassing now, but I'm very grateful.
3048149	3048790	Oh, my Lord!
3050346	3051128	Oh, my Lord!
3051148	3052672	That's a rear spoiler.
3053133	3054477	Not just any rear spoiler.
3054497	3057666	No, but a Richard Grant... Do you remember Richard Grant spoilers?
3057947	3058408	The actor.
3059305	3060745	Well, that's the thing.
3060765	3064426	The Richard Grant spoilers were on XR2s all through the 70s and 80s.
3065086	3067587	Turns out Richard E. Grant did Withnail and I. He did?
3067687	3068067	He did.
3068707	3070668	He then started the car accessory business.
3071068	3080790	But because he didn't want to damage his acting career, he dropped the E. Chaps, this is genuinely all spectacular news and I'm very, very... So you can fit that tonight.
3081030	3081730	I feel terrible.
3082410	3084652	I haven't got you any... Of course you haven't got me anything.
3084672	3085933	I haven't got you any gifts.
3085953	3091578	When have you two ever bought me... You bought me a shit oil painting in Vietnam.
3091598	3092619	It was lovely.
3093420	3093720	Shit.
3094201	3095582	And you've never bought me anything.
3095722	3097043	Have I never bought you anything?
3097063	3098424	Have I never bought you a gift?
3098464	3098684	No.
3099025	3102428	I bought you a galleon in Vietnam to put on the back of your motorcycle.
3103549	3108033	That night, we polished our cars, did all the necessary repairs,
3112105	3116087	and then met up for the sort of breakfast Mr Wilman never provided.
3116107	3119329	Is that my coffee?
3120410	3120610	Yes.
3120670	3121490	You ordered me a coffee?
3121550	3121690	Yes.
3122331	3123351	It's nearly a present.
3124912	3125092	Hey.
3126453	3126613	What?
3127534	3128674	Went to the bar last night.
3129014	3129335	Yeah.
3129455	3130415	Got talking to a man.
3131476	3132336	I bought this from him.
3135198	3135798	What is it?
3136479	3136859	Silver.
3138467	3139388	Actual silver.
3139769	3140009	Is it?
3140029	3142833	Nuggets of it, yes.
3142853	3143795	60 cents a gram.
3144315	3146799	Because it turns out... You know, we've been driving along.
3146919	3149763	On the surface, there's all the fruit and crops and so on.
3150204	3151245	Breadbasket of Africa.
3152527	3153008	Dig down.
3154369	3160430	Gold, silver, manganese, lithium, diamonds, coal, iron ore.
3160870	3168192	So you're ploughing a field to get your pineapples in, or your tea, or your bananas, or whatever it might be, and there's just diamonds and lithium.
3168292	3168492	Jewels.
3168612	3171373	Yeah, jewels and lithium and cobalt pouring out.
3171933	3176634	And I was thinking, you know people when they go on, well, we go on these trips, we always go home with a stupid souvenir.
3176894	3181158	Well, instead of buying some crappy nonsense, why don't we get some silver?
3182098	3183039	60 cents.
3183059	3184140	60 cents a gram.
3185501	3188984	We then rushed immediately into town and went shopping.
3190125	3191566	And we didn't hold back.
3194609	3198151	So, this is 45 kilograms of silver.
3198292	3199312	Best souvenir ever.
3199352	3199633	I know.
3200073	3202595	We could have gone back with an awful painting of a sunset.
3203256	3205698	This is going to affect my weight distribution, I'm going to be honest.
3206954	3208855	What is this going to add to the downforce for my wing?
3209255	3211376	I'm just trying to work out how much that cost.
3212336	3214437	Not a lot, according to what you... It was 60 cents a gram.
3214757	3215018	Yes.
3215658	3218939	But we got a discount for quantity, and then the change you gave me was this.
3219660	3226983	So I paid in US... What is that?
3227003	3227503	50... 50 million?
3227683	3228744	Mm.
3228764	3229044	$50 million.
3229604	3233005	I know when they had really big hyperinflation, it was a million percent, wasn't it?
3233025	3233746	Something like that, yeah.
3234602	3241588	And at one point, I think with a $50 million note, it was cheaper to wipe the bottom with this than it was to use one single sheet of laboratory paper.
3241649	3242770	It was absolutely cheaper.
3243150	3248635	And that's why if people ordered a coffee, they'd pay for it when they got it rather than after they'd drunk it, because it would have gone up.
3249055	3251938	Anyway... Enough financial matters.
3251958	3258004	So we've got 45 kilograms of silver and $50 million.
3258344	3259205	We are in a good place.
3261325	3272330	Having fired up our fully repaired silver machines, we headed out of town, fairly convinced that no city on earth gives better avenue.
3273690	3276051	Those purple trees are breathtaking.
3277532	3279072	Are these really jacaranda trees?
3279312	3279773	Yeah, they are.
3279933	3280433	Look at that.
3280493	3281413	They're beautiful.
3286495	3287276	Oh, look at this.
3293410	3296451	That's the most beautiful avenue of trees I think I've ever seen.
3303055	3315520	With Jeremy on map reading duties, we headed due west on a rather brilliant ribbon of tarmac.
3315580	3320783	Road is good, scenery is good, things are good.
3337205	3340608	For hours, the journey was completely trouble-free.
3341929	3345932	And it continued to be trouble-free till I stopped to check the map.
3348474	3351117	Then it wasn't trouble-free anymore.
3352257	3352538	Shit.
3353158	3354179	What for have you stopped?
3354880	3355500	Good news.
3355961	3356321	Go on.
3356621	3357182	Good news.
3357282	3358002	Very good news.
3359443	3361065	I know exactly which road we're on.
3364192	3365212	There is some bad news.
3365933	3366193	Yes?
3366573	3367393	It's the wrong road.
3368133	3368573	What's happened?
3368873	3369634	We're on the wrong road.
3370674	3371834	Who said they knew where they were going?
3371974	3374415	I... Was it... I... It wasn't you.
3374435	3375996	No, it was, like, another voice.
3376056	3376656	It wasn't me.
3376676	3380177	Get bogged down and, ooh, turned left and, ooh, turned... It was you.
3380197	3380977	It was me.
3381577	3383558	So, we're on the wrong... You've got us on the wrong road.
3383578	3385239	We're on the wrong... We should be heading west.
3385439	3385799	We're not.
3385899	3386819	We're heading north.
3387879	3388180	Show me.
3388220	3388920	We face a choice.
3389000	3392581	We can either go all the way back to Harare... No.
3394321	3396744	and take that turn, which you should have done.
3397464	3400667	Or, if we keep heading north... On the wrong road?
3400687	3400848	Yeah.
3401228	3405793	If we keep heading north, we will eventually get to the Zambezi, which is the border with Zambia.
3405993	3406653	Big river.
3406814	3407274	Can't miss it.
3408475	3411298	Hang a left, we know we're going west.
3412379	3415682	Well, that is broadly true, because the river goes like that and the road goes like that.
3416303	3416984	So, there we are.
3422492	3430774	Having processed the fact that instead of doing this... we'd been doing this... we soldiered on.
3433674	3436475	I think we'll make it to the Zambezi by nightfall.
3437455	3439375	We could camp by the Zambezi.
3440456	3441676	How cool would that be?
3443556	3446257	But then... the tarmac ran out.
3454889	3455949	Don't let this be washboard.
3456149	3457150	Oh, God!
3458210	3458811	It is!
3462652	3465233	Chaps, there's about 40 miles to the river now.
3465253	3465613	40 miles.
3465633	3466013	14 miles.
3466814	3467534	No, no, James.
3467554	3468014	40 miles.
3468774	3471556	Four zero miles.
3471636	3471556	40?
3473616	3473856	Yes.
3474337	3476838	I'm afraid that's about the sum of it, yes.
3484616	3485677	I've really battled it.
3486998	3487838	Oh, wait, I'm stopping.
3487878	3488079	What?
3489920	3491701	Chaps, I'm breaking down.
3493603	3494123	It's OK.
3494163	3494824	Mine's fine.
3496245	3496545	Oh, no.
3497185	3497966	I smell fuel.
3500188	3506833	First job is put something white on, because the tsetse flies are attracted to blue and black.
3510154	3510855	Oh, shit!
3511636	3513137	All my petrol is falling out.
3514018	3515119	Oh, no, that's bad.
3516200	3518002	This is the fuel pipe.
3518302	3520304	This is the fuel.
3523968	3525369	That's your... Thank you.
3525630	3528833	What I could do... Is petrol coming out of your hot car?
3529493	3530294	Is this a good idea?
3530314	3530835	Thank you.
3531363	3534187	Well, would one of you fancy standing here with their finger on the end of this?
3534227	3534848	No, not really.
3535308	3537551	Just try to explain so I can understand.
3538252	3541877	It's come off... The line from the petrol tank up to the engine goes to there.
3541997	3545161	So there must be a pipe from... Well, have you just snapped?
3545701	3546683	No, it's come undone.
3546923	3547604	Why are you helping him?
3548104	3551126	I want Hammond to survive, otherwise we can't see him as Button.
3551206	3552047	Oh, please!
3553228	3554669	Stop it with the Buttons!
3555090	3555850	Oh, no, we won't.
3556611	3561315	How many years do you think it is before he is appearing as Button?
3561335	3562135	Please!
3562175	3562315	What?
3562556	3566419	No, I think his pride... He's got enough pride to make him last two years.
3566759	3568340	So this one goes out in 2024, this probe.
3568400	3569001	So I think it'll be 2025.
3569321	3569802	Possibly Guildford.
3572944	3574725	God, I'm soaked in petrol!
3575145	3576626	Guildford's quite a big theatre, though.
3576666	3579307	I know, Guildford is quite... I think there's Swindon Wyverns where he's gonna be.
3579327	3579988	There's like 200 people.
3580288	3580908	They're the cast.
3580948	3582129	Here it is.
3582149	3586411	Ainsley Harriot, Laurence Lombo, Julian Clarey, Richard Hammond.
3586431	3588672	That is a star-studded line-up, that is.
3588692	3592714	Laurie Hunniford and, and it was at the bottom, and Richard Hammond as Buttons!
3594583	3600508	Following his illustrious career, travelling the globe... Why don't you say TV's Richard Hammond?
3600788	3604091	Because he's done enough programmes for him to be TV's Richard Hammond.
3604872	3606353	Hammond, we're going to come and see you.
3606693	3607274	I'm going to say.
3608014	3610757	On your first night, there will be two elderly gentlemen in the front row.
3610777	3611017	First night?
3611297	3611818	Every night.
3612919	3616201	I mean, I hate panto, but I'm going to that one.
3616522	3619344	Think of the premier in reward points you're going to get.
3619364	3619584	Oh, God!
3619664	3622527	If you're doing the Sunday matinee, you can have the carvery special.
3624946	3632872	Predicting that this wouldn't be the last time we'd be standing around a broken capri, I went to put on my anti-tetzefly shirt.
3633833	3636716	And then I spotted something in the undergrowth.
3638237	3638597	Oh, hello.
3638617	3640759	Ooh!
3641700	3643261	I've got a bonnet ornament, guys.
3644422	3645643	Remember on the old lines here?
3645663	3646784	Oh, wow!
3646884	3648705	Look at that.
3649366	3650066	That's brilliant.
3650387	3650607	I know.
3653971	3656592	Eventually, Buttons was back on the road.
3658193	3659373	Just checking my fuel gauge.
3660253	3661234	I lost a fair bit.
3662534	3673718	And then, with 30 miles to go, the washboard became so vicious... it even started to play havoc with the normally bulletproof stag.
3674519	3677640	What if Windstream Wipers randomly come on?
3679420	3680741	Stop it, Windstream Wipers.
3687606	3690468	Stop wiping the windscreen, you stupid rubber bastards!
3693730	3701694	It was as if the washboard, our nemesis for the last 20 years, knew it was his last chance to break us.
3721471	3723012	I have no throttle control.
3725874	3728055	Yeah, foot's not on the accelerator now.
3728656	3729837	And we're just driving along.
3730077	3735281	Put it under the accelerator to lift it off.
3735341	3739124	This has properly, properly started to break my Lancia.
3739784	3740224	And me.
3741185	3741806	Oh, God!
3746317	3757466	However, despite their great age, our cars held together until eventually... we reached the banks of the Zambezi.
3758747	3759448	Oh, my God.
3760249	3764032	Where Mother Nature had laid on quite a reception.
3767398	3767538	StSq2 2.60
3797383	3798263	It's not a bad spot.
3803865	3806185	After dinner, we had a lovely pudding.
3806505	3807065	Cheesecake.
3808406	3812227	And this being Zimbabwe... Now, would you like some gold on it?
3812247	3813567	Yes, please.
3813607	3814587	Yeah, I would, actually.
3814927	3816408	I got it when we were in Harare.
3816868	3821529	The great thing about it as well is you do a golden turd the next day and it becomes valuable.
3824266	3825547	Which is just extravagant.
3825567	3826088	Thanks, Hammond.
3826948	3827209	May?
3827349	3828249	Yes, please.
3828410	3830812	Because if you think about it, they grow everything here.
3831212	3833494	And then you dig a hole in the ground for your pudding.
3834215	3834555	Gold.
3835416	3836436	Hey, that gives me an idea.
3837878	3843342	Why don't we melt our silver and then we can make gift items to take home with us?
3844103	3845284	Out of our souvenir silver?
3845304	3846945	Do you have to make a mould?
3848307	3850669	Are you proposing that we do craft?
3851818	3853179	Well, what else can we do?
3853199	3855961	It's twenty past six.
3856762	3857842	Drinking's going well.
3857963	3862005	Yes, drinking's good, but eventually you'll be wrestling a baboon.
3862065	3863486	You always do that sort of thing.
3865648	3872513	In a state of deep joy, James quickly built all that we needed to start smelting our silver.
3884167	3888149	And two small drinks later, things were looking good.
3889530	3890490	There you go, chaps.
3891231	3891751	Look at that.
3892552	3893392	Holy cow!
3894553	3895693	So now we can make anything.
3896073	3898074	Literally anything that we can cast.
3898795	3906379	Yeah, so you make a hole in something, pour that in, let it solidify... And then you've got a thing in silver.
3906879	3907219	Right.
3907299	3907680	Come on, then.
3908920	3910281	Gentlemen, let's get to work.
3911121	3911842	I'll mend my throttle.
3913158	3914620	then I'll make something silvery.
3914940	3922889	Actually, no, I'll make the mould, put the silver in it, let it solidify, and while it's solidifying, I'll mend my throttle linkage.
3923049	3925452	Welcome to a world of ordered thinking.
3937867	3943092	The next morning, the banks of the Zambezi were carpeted with many different animals.
3944393	3945434	And Roger Moore.
3948197	3949218	Have you had that made?
3949698	3949939	Yep.
3951160	3952321	Whose measurements did you send?
3952421	3953222	Jon Bon Jovi's.
3953382	3955004	I was a little ambitious.
3955484	3958347	You know what it is, when the doctor says, how many units of alcohol do you drink?
3958407	3960189	And when somebody says, what are your measurements?
3960785	3963066	Definitely 30-inch waist, 40-inch chest.
3963186	3963566	I lied.
3963686	3965987	Have you noticed what he's done here?
3966587	3968688	Very flamboyant buttons.
3968708	3969388	Buttons, yes.
3970488	3972349	It's like he's easing himself into the role.
3972669	3973349	Oh, no!
3973409	3976511	Can we just move on from his sartorial faux pas?
3976931	3977071	Oh!
3977531	3978931	Isn't it magnificent?
3979031	3980592	Is that what you made out of your silver?
3980612	3982113	That's starkly, isn't it?
3982133	3982933	Why is nobody... Well...
3983573	3984934	I wonder why nobody's done that before.
3984974	3990176	Your steering wheel, actually, your solid silver steering wheel, that's another 900,000 pounds.
3990336	3992657	I mean, it does look pretty cool, doesn't it?
3992677	3993317	Don't give a bling.
3993777	3994858	Bonnet ornament.
3995638	3996158	Is it the bonnet?
3996178	3997139	But it's not on the bonnet, though.
3997199	3999600	It isn't, but you see... Ah, but it is the bonnet.
3999640	4000900	Wait a minute, this is at the back.
4000960	4002661	Does it become an engine cover, not a bonnet?
4002781	4003442	It's an engine cover.
4003462	4004862	Yeah, but you can't say engine cover ornament.
4004922	4005402	No, you can't.
4005422	4006263	It's a fine ornament.
4006323	4006983	I love it.
4007023	4007983	It looks brilliant.
4008003	4008464	Look at that.
4008484	4009024	It's on the wrong end.
4009344	4013825	That is an Impala on a Monte Carlo, so I'm basically a Chevrolet advertiser.
4013845	4015846	Isn't it remarkable what makes sense in our world?
4017046	4017587	What?
4017607	4018167	That doesn't.
4018627	4019027	Oh, yeah.
4019047	4019587	I just saw it.
4019787	4020467	Yeah, yeah.
4020487	4020968	Check it out.
4021088	4021388	Come on.
4021768	4023628	Stuart Little Spoiler, ladies and gentlemen.
4023648	4024208	Oh, the width.
4024549	4026389	Yeah, that's all the silver I had.
4026989	4029330	It's quite... It is Stuart Little Spoiler.
4030050	4030670	It's pretty.
4031631	4031951	Anyway...
4033137	4036879	We now have silver adornments to our cars.
4037279	4038300	Can I make a suggestion?
4039921	4041261	Keep the river on your right.
4041281	4042542	It's not navigationally challenging.
4042562	4043703	Navigation is not a problem today.
4043763	4045904	And we know we are heading west.
4046684	4050226	And we know if we keep heading west, we'll get to the other side of Zimbabwe.
4050386	4052047	And we know we're going to look good doing it.
4085709	4087230	Big skin on the Zambese!
4091914	4095377	That might be my last ever televised skin.
4096758	4098220	It's strange when you think about it, because...
4099457	4103318	Everybody does everything in their life for the last time at some point.
4103678	4109539	The last time you dive off a boat, the last time you kick a football, the last time you do sex.
4110239	4115340	But you don't know when you're doing it that you're doing it for the last time.
4119681	4121241	So I shall remember that skit.
4122881	4126182	After a spirited morning drive,
4129099	4130660	We got back on tarmac.
4133523	4136165	Which had yellow lines and everything.
4138687	4140668	This is like the Stelvio Pass.
4141689	4142350	What a road!
4146744	4149706	And the little Monte Carlo was lapping it up.
4150948	4151788	I've said it before.
4152229	4160075	If you absolutely must do African exploration, you absolutely must have a Lancia.
4161856	4163438	It's chucked out of gear.
4164739	4165219	Oh, God.
4165459	4165980	Back in again.
4178199	4180041	Love that sound.
4181282	4185625	And all you lot growing up today with your electric cars, you're never going to hear it.
4187727	4197514	There are lots of reasons why we're jacking this show in, but for me, one of the main ones is I'm simply not interested in electric cars.
4198195	4200456	They are just white goods.
4200496	4201517	They're washing machines.
4201577	4203619	They're microwave ovens.
4203819	4204860	You can't review those.
4204900	4205981	You can't enjoy them.
4206880	4208521	They are just shit.
4210723	4213725	Chaps, I've done something for the first time in my life.
4214745	4216086	Masturbated on television?
4216827	4217467	No, it's worse.
4217527	4220249	I've put on a pair of stringback driving gloves.
4221290	4222090	Why have you done that?
4222831	4228035	My silver bling steering wheel is great, but now the sun's on it, it gets a bit hot.
4232725	4239566	We carried on driving along the lovely road until the lovely road suddenly stopped.
4242107	4253909	Um... Oh.
4258149	4261110	You total plumsack.
4261715	4262275	It's a lake.
4264216	4264856	Is it?
4265556	4266477	I saw it on the map.
4267797	4270178	I just assumed there'd be a road round it and there isn't.
4270198	4275060	Erm... Why isn't there a road round it?
4277122	4277743	So, wait a minute.
4277783	4279144	You went wrong in Harare.
4279164	4280025	Let's establish that.
4280045	4281166	You chose the wrong road.
4281186	4281926	There were only two.
4281986	4283307	You chose the wrong one.
4283528	4287051	You then doggedly made us... Beautiful.
4287091	4288872	The Nürburgring, that last bit.
4289072	4292155	A nice bit at the end, but it turned out to be the end.
4299381	4302544	We can't turn right, because literally just there, it's Zambia.
4303345	4303525	Yes.
4304804	4306145	You can't go left.
4306305	4307145	There isn't a road.
4309166	4312548	So... we'll just float across.
4312628	4313569	Oh, don't be ridiculous.
4314169	4315170	Honestly, we've done enough.
4315790	4320232	Car, boat, boat, cars, rafts... We're not building boats.
4320472	4321833	It never works.
4321853	4322874	I've got a better idea.
4323294	4323914	Buy a boat.
4324194	4324995	Buy three boats.
4325235	4326416	We've got to get the cars on.
4326456	4327316	Yes, exactly.
4327336	4327856	Buy boats.
4327937	4328917	They've got boats.
4329397	4330778	But they're people's boats.
4331358	4331959	Well, buy them.
4332739	4333319	I've got wedge.
4334700	4335120	10 trillion?
4336041	4336401	50 billion?
4336601	4337341	Yeah, why not?
4337601	4338701	Yeah, I'll have another 50 billion.
4338721	4344783	100 billion, 350 billion, 400 billion.
4344803	4347084	10 trillion, 400 billion and 20.
4347264	4350525	This is absolutely idiotic.
4351665	4352506	Right, boat buying.
4357347	4363369	Having spent the morning rootling around the local boatyards, we reconvened with our purchases.
4364693	4367695	James had gone for an old sardine fishing boat.
4369616	4371597	I'd bought an aquatic hatchback.
4372938	4377340	And Jeremy, naturally, had purchased a floating drinks cabinet.
4378801	4380002	You've bought a bar.
4380462	4381523	It's also the bridge.
4381543	4384565	You steer it from the bar.
4386446	4388067	Once we'd loaded up our cars,
4395322	4398724	We assembled on HMS Sardine for a map chat.
4400445	4401425	Are they nautical charts?
4402346	4403086	No, it's a road map.
4404387	4406347	Right, we're going to see... So here's the lake.
4406868	4407068	Yes.
4408168	4414251	We're going to... There's the lake.
4414471	4415672	Yes, there's the lake.
4419986	4420427	What's that?
4420647	4422609	Oh, bloody hell.
4422629	4424811	That's the rest... Yes.
4426313	4427294	That goes to there.
4428415	4428756	OK.
4430878	4432220	It's about 180 miles.
4433121	4433982	It's 175 miles.
4434222	4435603	Oh, well, that's all right, then.
4435644	4437486	Thank God we haven't got to do that extra five miles.
4438046	4440369	It's the world's largest man-made lake.
4442717	4444197	I'm genuinely sorry about this.
4444378	4446598	I had not... Look, you can see the problem.
4447158	4449839	We've driven all the way... I've just been using this side of the map.
4449959	4451880	No, Jeremy, we can see the problem.
4452480	4453740	It's there, pointing at the map.
4453880	4454661	The map is accurate.
4454821	4456561	You didn't look at the other side.
4456581	4461983	It was all folded up in such a way that you didn't see... How fast does your boat go?
4462203	4463963	I don't know yet, but not very, I'm going to guess.
4464363	4466304	I think we're talking about a brisk walk.
4467208	4471072	Eve, if they do ten knots... Ten miles... Did I say ten miles an hour?
4471132	4472433	That's 18 hours.
4473334	4474194	That's overnight.
4475155	4475355	Yes.
4477377	4479219	I then did a bit more research.
4479959	4481701	And that wasn't a great move either.
4481721	4482902	It gets worse.
4484023	4484263	Why?
4485444	4487086	Guess how many crocodiles are in that lake?
4487947	4488527	I don't know.
4489308	4490229	Somewhere between 100 and 250,000.
4496271	4496891	Crocodiles?
4497412	4498112	Two weeks ago.
4498452	4499733	They had to shoot a man-eater.
4500894	4501634	Would you like to see it?
4503815	4505396	Jeez, that is... Look at it!
4505937	4507097	I didn't think crocodiles could be that big.
4507117	4507838	Look at this boat!
4508678	4513301	On average, 47 people a year are killed by crocodiles.
4513781	4516523	And there aren't that many people here to start with.
4523507	4524768	On that sombre note...
4526223	4527044	We set off.
4531109	4533912	HMS Simfeist is underway.
4535634	4538578	Under the watchful eye of the lake's residents.
4540801	4545727	If I think of this not so much as water as just a solid lump of crocodiles.
4554600	4554920	Right.
4555941	4557161	Safety check's complete.
4558242	4560002	There's only one thing I can think to do.
4562443	4564544	I believe Jeremy's already poured himself a drink.
4566385	4568846	Mr. Slowly driving HMS Eco.
4583681	4590827	It's extraordinary to think that in 1955, this didn't exist, it was just normal Africa.
4591488	4600135	And the British came and said, actually, we're going to build a dam across the Zambezi to create hydroelectric power for Zambia and Zimbabwe.
4601716	4602737	And this was the result.
4611014	4613835	biggest man-made lake the world has ever seen.
4614035	4631938	We've done some daft things in our time, but I'm really enjoying this one.
4633019	4635199	I'm sailing a bar with a Lancia on it.
4636699	4639200	And I've got a lot of drink to get through.
4641528	4648870	So much, in fact, that I invited Buttons and Greta Thunberg over... to share the workload.
4650610	4652351	I like the look of that.
4652751	4657632	I have a wide range of drinks from the 1970s, including the much-missed Galliano.
4658112	4659193	Nice.
4659453	4660333	Step back in time.
4661013	4661613	Gin and tonic, sir.
4661633	4662974	I would love a gin and tonic, thank you.
4663014	4663614	Coming right up.
4663794	4665194	And you, sir, a Chablis, I'm guessing.
4667655	4667975	Thank you.
4669179	4670621	Ice and a slice of gold, perhaps?
4670981	4672182	Ice and a slice of gold would be wonderful.
4675105	4679230	So if you go in that water, basically you are going to be eaten by a crocodile.
4679590	4682533	And I can't think of a death I would enjoy less.
4683334	4685877	Yeah, it's not the agony, actually.
4686590	4686790	No.
4687291	4687852	It is the agony.
4687952	4688633	It is the agony.
4688693	4690075	But it's the indignity.
4690275	4691457	It's ignominium.
4692037	4701250	Groddard comes along, you're there dangling your feet in the water, thinking about life, filled with hopes, expectations, loves, dreams, thoughts of the universe.
4701510	4703411	A crocodile says, I love that.
4703711	4704091	Bang!
4704411	4704691	Gone.
4704931	4706352	You know peanuts on a bar?
4706892	4711494	You're having a drink with some friends, you see some peanuts, you take a couple of peanuts... Bit more salt.
4711514	4712995	That is what you are.
4713015	4714435	Do you know what makes it worse?
4714796	4716356	A crocodile is prehistoric.
4716856	4718557	So it was mates with T. rex.
4719077	4721078	It's 250 million years old.
4721158	4722039	And humanity is what?
4722059	4722039	250, 200,000?
4722159	4723279	And civilization is only about 6,000 years old.
4728081	4745974	So everything from the first cave paintings all the way up to the present day, in the time span of evolution, that has all happened while the crocodile has been scratching his... After an hour or so of drinking and chatting and sailing, but mostly drinking, the conversation started to take a bit of a dip.
4746894	4747495	I've got...
4748759	4751261	Three quarters of a bottle of vodka, half a bottle of gin.
4751321	4752781	No, that's not gin.
4752821	4753222	What is that?
4753242	4754002	I don't know.
4754482	4756543	This is a blended brandy.
4756984	4758665	And I also have here a blended whiskey.
4758765	4759865	Hammond, your boat's buggered off.
4762147	4763507	That's got my passport on it.
4764748	4765268	Shall I go?
4765608	4767369	You're going to have to leave my bar.
4767409	4769431	Do you want to come with me, Hammond, or stay here?
4770211	4773733	This is more manoeuvrable, so we'll manoeuvre this up to mine and I'll get off this onto mine.
4776167	4777127	Right, now, here we go.
4777227	4778488	International rescue.
4779188	4780789	Please, catch my Capri.
4780809	4782409	I'll give it my best work.
4786711	4787651	Don't fall in the water.
4788011	4789492	Crocodiles, definite death.
4789512	4791693	Oh, I left the gin.
4791893	4793253	Would you like another one before you go?
4793273	4794014	I do love one, yes.
4798555	4805518	We continued with our long journey and as darkness fell, we realised we were a bit peckish.
4809309	4813473	So, to catch some supper, James lowered his sardine nets.
4816315	4819898	And... there we are at depth.
4820679	4825123	I don't mind if it isn't sardines, if it's just like general fish, but I'd really like sardines.
4825683	4826764	It should be sardines.
4826784	4828125	This is a sardine boat.
4835171	4835792	Here we go.
4841018	4841538	Bollocks!
4844501	4845641	I'm starving!
4845681	4847042	I know, I'm starving as well.
4847123	4848464	No, I'm beyond hungry!
4851786	4852607	It's crisps, isn't it?
4852987	4853567	It's crisps.
4853807	4854308	It's crisps.
4855889	4862394	And as if things couldn't get any worse... I've now run out of ice.
4868968	4880691	So we recharged our glasses with warm drink and fuelled by that, crisps and some wistful memories, we sailed on.
4884612	4885673	It's going to be a long night.
4888413	4889133	Not our first.
4890114	4891794	Ordinarily, I'd say not our last.
4894115	4894555	Maybe it is.
4896414	4899137	Now stop saying those things, Richard.
4899257	4916296	What a job this has been.
4917137	4917838	What a career.
4954639	4964929	That was a long night.
4965970	4966791	Very long night.
4981377	4984300	There was, however, some good news.
4986202	4987683	Little blue dot, that's us.
4989125	4990846	We are nearing the end of the lake.
4993049	5005101	And because we were nearing shore, we were surrounded by our tompy friends, which made the sudden message from our director on a camera tracking boat all the more alarming.
5006275	5006475	What?
5006515	5008937	Give it some power, full power.
5058353	5059674	It's like you've saved the Capri.
5060814	5064236	Sorry, I've only just heard, because of the noise of the engine, what's happened?
5064636	5068037	His boat, if you look, it was definitely sinking from the rear.
5068057	5071419	The whole of the back of his pontoons were underwater.
5071839	5076481	Do not try and come in here, because I came over sandbags.
5076601	5079522	I literally just hammered straight over low ground to get here.
5081443	5084964	James and I arrived at another spot along the shore.
5085385	5086045	There's a ramp.
5087771	5092472	And once we'd all disembarked... Oh, I've definitely arrived.
5093372	5098714	I called another map meeting, because during the night I'd had a brainwave.
5100474	5101894	So, we've just come across Kariba.
5103815	5112037	When we reach the border here and cross it, we have gone all the way across Zimbabwe, which is what we set out to do, and we've finished the programme.
5112737	5115838	Well done, us and our three improbable cars.
5116098	5116478	However...
5118022	5119737	On the other side of the border is Botswana.
5121016	5124339	So, if you just turn the map over, which I've learned to do.
5124459	5125160	Well done.
5125200	5125960	It's a technique.
5126441	5128162	If you look, this is the Macadacaddy, yeah?
5128703	5129263	Salt pans.
5129823	5133547	And there is Coober Wilderland, and that is where we began.
5133907	5138030	That's where we did our very first special 17 years ago.
5138050	5138110	Wow.
5140172	5144135	We've always said this is one of our favourite places anywhere we've ever encountered.
5144156	5145657	And it's where the Beoban trees are.
5145757	5145957	Yeah.
5146497	5147578	I'd like to finish there.
5148759	5152303	I think that's right.
5152343	5153524	And that's only... 120 miles or so.
5153544	5154565	Yeah, I'm up for that.
5155025	5160470	So we end this programme here and we wrap the Grand Tour up there.
5160490	5161792	I think that's a tremendous idea.
5162112	5162632	It's fitting.
5166876	5172322	With our new plan agreed on, we set a course for the border, feeling pretty good.
5175134	5176514	Well, this is wonderful, viewers.
5176554	5177915	We're back on proper tarmac.
5177935	5180895	The sun isn't above my head yet, so my steering wheel hasn't heated up.
5181795	5182876	I love this moment.
5188797	5189077	Boom!
5194178	5199099	But a couple of miles later, the jolliness came to an abrupt end.
5199799	5199939	Jeez!
5207222	5208123	Pothole hell.
5212508	5213009	Oh, no!
5213529	5215472	I don't believe my tyres survived that one.
5216232	5222980	The potholes, which were nearly as bad as the ones in England, were not good news for the most fragile car here.
5223581	5223741	Shit!
5237432	5237712	Ooh!
5238433	5239254	Oh, shit!
5240815	5245779	I am, for the first time, seriously starting to wonder if this car can take it.
5246961	5247961	And if it's gonna get there.
5255748	5258571	Something very much amiss on the rear axle.
5260152	5261634	Sounds like a bag of cutlery.
5262892	5267274	I hate to say it, I think I should just have a quick look just to make sure the back axle's not going to come off.
5270336	5273498	The news from underneath my car wasn't good.
5274398	5274618	Right.
5277340	5277640	There.
5278661	5280502	That's one shock absorber.
5280542	5282463	It's not connected at that end anymore.
5282563	5284044	Yes, I see the problem, sir.
5284364	5288666	Every time the axle comes up, that was going up, punching a hole in the body.
5288746	5289607	Have you actually made holes?
5289847	5290167	Yes.
5290267	5291748	So I'm going to have to run without it.
5292691	5298815	This young guy is saying that if it had been him, he would have bought the 2.8 injection, not the 3-litre GXL.
5299115	5299495	Is he?
5299736	5300016	Yeah.
5301337	5302878	He says it's got a much stronger axle.
5304759	5308481	Annoyingly, the other shock absorber had to come off as well.
5309942	5311623	So, you're just running on leaf springs, yeah?
5311823	5311983	Yeah.
5312304	5315406	Like, it is exactly the same as the medieval oxcars.
5315826	5315966	Yeah.
5320558	5325622	For Jeremy and me, though, it was much more entertaining than a medieval oxcart.
5326683	5340013	I'm going to crash!
5340173	5345297	If you wanted to know what a shock absorber does, it stops cars doing that.
5346178	5349801	Yeah, I'm still in it.
5352850	5357292	Representing Great Britain in car trampoline, it's Richard Hammond from Ross-on-Wye.
5359633	5365776	Sadly, the Ford Space Hopper Entertainment soon came to an end because Zimbabwe changed again.
5366456	5367876	And we could no longer see it.
5369797	5369937	God.
5370017	5371418	I can't breathe.
5383075	5390819	Right, so everything's now covered with a veneer of coal dust because we're in the coal mining area.
5393221	5396363	That's why all the trees and everything are black.
5397623	5398284	Oh, come on.
5398344	5398984	Come on.
5403407	5405388	If it's like this all the way to the border, well...
5409110	5415193	Then, through the choking dust, I spotted what could be our salvation.
5422176	5424577	This road is intolerable, would you not agree?
5426138	5430840	Since we got off the boats this morning, I have been shaken to pieces.
5430940	5432601	My car is falling to pieces.
5432961	5435682	That's a particularly virulent type of dust as well.
5436062	5436983	And I'm looking at this.
5439226	5440426	Well, that's not bumpy, is it?
5441807	5442947	Well, no, it's a railway line.
5442967	5446349	So why don't we convert our cars to run on the railway lines?
5447069	5447769	We've done it before.
5448630	5448890	Ah, yes.
5448910	5449590	We've done it before.
5449630	5450110	Yes, we have.
5450570	5455332	What other group of blokes can actually say with experience that it can be done?
5455392	5455952	We've done it.
5456012	5456533	We've done it.
5457833	5459634	We'd have to check the train timetables.
5460970	5462371	That sort of thing's really important.
5462811	5467355	We'd also need to find a workshop where we could make the modifications necessary to our cars.
5467375	5469256	We need a big town and a lot of machinery.
5469276	5470437	Vic Falls isn't far away.
5470517	5476401	It's not one of ours.
5481964	5482444	Carry on.
5483084	5484385	Oh, they're quite pleased anyway.
5484405	5486125	Right, so you've called some locals knobheads.
5486345	5487485	I just called him a dickhead.
5487605	5487825	Yeah.
5488105	5489486	They're coming out to beat the crap out of you.
5489506	5490006	Yeah, no, they're not.
5490246	5490506	Hello.
5490546	5491366	How are you, guys?
5491566	5492106	Hi, everybody.
5492126	5492926	He said you were knobheads.
5492946	5493826	Sorry we're in the way.
5494287	5496887	This traditional English greeting, I'm telling you we're Alice.
5496967	5497447	It's fine.
5497527	5498267	This is your home.
5498667	5499268	Mate, how are you?
5499288	5499928	Good to see you.
5500708	5501228	Good to meet you.
5502188	5510650	Once Kofi Clarkson had repaired diplomatic relations... ..we set off on our detour to Victoria Falls.
5522534	5525535	Now, everything's on fire.
5525555	5528396	Oh, my God, actually everything is on fire.
5531057	5533278	We are having some obstacles today, aren't we?
5537359	5541540	Once we reached Vic Falls, our thoughts turned to the matter of accommodation.
5542961	5546102	And since the tight-fisted Mr Wilman wasn't with us,
5555417	5555937	Afternoon.
5556097	5556497	Thank you.
5556517	5557997	Could we have three sweets, please?
5558597	5561098	And if you could have my tailor sent out, that would be tremendous.
5562438	5563639	That's what Bond always says.
5564619	5571401	Then, after we'd washed the coal dust out of our ears, we found a workshop and cued the music.
5608180	5611101	A couple of days later, the work was complete.
5611922	5616284	And we met in the local rail yard to compare our contraptions.
5618845	5620186	Surprisingly simple job.
5621506	5628450	I've put the front wheels in a sort of animal feed trough, which has little railway wheels on the bottom.
5628530	5634953	At the back, rear wheels drive that sort of belt system, which then drives the railway wheels.
5635273	5637274	It's simple and it's elegant.
5638843	5639383	Unlike that.
5640164	5641024	Yeah, let me talk you through this.
5641064	5649290	Mine's quite elaborate, and I suspect you're not interested, but I based it on the diesel hydraulic locomotives of England's western region.
5649590	5650430	It's hydraulic drive.
5650470	5658996	The engine merely drives a pump, which charges the hydraulic reservoir, which is what then drives the wheels, giving you massive torque at standstill from zero revs.
5659096	5660277	How does it work?
5660397	5661217	That's how it works.
5661297	5662238	I didn't understand.
5662498	5664600	James, what the bloody hell's that?
5664680	5665481	Yeah, well, I did warn you.
5666041	5668923	Oh, my Lord, there's a whole... What is... What's all that?
5669104	5670245	That's a hydraulic pump.
5671125	5672386	This is a hydraulic reservoir.
5672406	5673687	These are pipes.
5674728	5676570	Those are gauges to warn you of the pressures.
5676810	5677531	Warn you of the pressures.
5677551	5678411	How will you see them?
5678491	5678872	I won't.
5679893	5683656	As long as they're right... Unless you've got a co-pilot who is a giraffe.
5684176	5686737	The point about the hydraulic system is it's the transmission.
5687317	5690558	This is how they built real locomotives, so this is proven technology.
5690578	5692139	It doesn't look like a real locomotive.
5692159	5692999	Well, it does, actually.
5693039	5696520	If you took the... No, it does look... It looks like a Triumph Stag on top of a Scratch.
5696540	5698721	I'm visualizing the Flying Scotsman, the Mallard.
5698781	5699221	Got it.
5699241	5699921	Fixed.
5700001	5700761	Open your eyes.
5700821	5701522	Is it made real?
5701742	5701882	No.
5702122	5702202	No.
5703174	5704695	Yours looks even easier than mine.
5704715	5705876	You don't even need to go over there.
5706156	5710039	Sits on rollers, back wheels turn rollers, rollers turn wheel, it goes along.
5710279	5710519	End of.
5710760	5712081	So it's just like a rolling road?
5712441	5713502	Yeah, it's like a running machine.
5714122	5718465	James, Hammond and I have proved there's a very easy way of doing this.
5718846	5723529	But you've got to manipulate your clutch, your throttle, your brake pedal.
5723649	5724230	All I have to do...
5725030	5726191	Driving a car?
5726211	5727492	But it's not a car, you see.
5727552	5728033	It's a locomotive.
5728073	5732697	All I have to do is set the engine revs and then I simply move a lever backwards and forwards.
5732737	5736800	The very thing that made those early locomotives so appealing to people who'd grown up on steam.
5740043	5740763	Shall we do this?
5740844	5743486	They'll miss me when I'm gone, which is in a few days' time.
5745387	5749111	We boarded our trains, ready for the off.
5750372	5751713	Hydraulic pressure is building.
5754588	5758931	The train now departing platform one is the Monte Carlo Express.
5759591	5761513	Direct service to Botswana.
5763734	5764575	Here we go.
5764595	5770899	I'm coming along.
5785367	5786228	Right, we're away.
5788651	5788911	What?
5790133	5791915	No, I'm not... I mean... Ow!
5796380	5798743	It makes very authentic train noises if you hear the little...
5811710	5815471	Uh, I've derailed.
5816292	5816712	Oh, dear.
5816732	5822534	I'm going to have to reverse to see what his problem is.
5824835	5825416	Yes!
5825436	5829397	The Monte Carlo Express goes forwards and backwards.
5829778	5830458	There you go, there.
5832159	5834040	What a machine I have built here.
5840109	5843172	This meant that James and I had both derailed.
5844793	5845774	But it could be worse.
5848376	5849717	Oh, bugger.
5851238	5862827	So that wheel turns that way, which turns these wheels the other way, which means it goes the other way to the way these wheels are turning.
5864589	5864669	Um...
5866588	5866908	Right.
5868989	5876573	Luckily, as we hadn't actually left the station, there was a telehandler on hand to help sort out our problems.
5877994	5883417	I'm going to pick it up and turn it around so that when it's going backwards, it's going forwards.
5885038	5891141	So what this means is I've now got four reverse gears that make me go forwards.
5894163	5894383	Right.
5894623	5895704	Now, simply...
5897059	5898060	Put it back on the track.
5900262	5900762	No problem.
5901163	5902064	Everything's under control.
5904286	5908790	And when all of us were back on tracks, we set off once more.
5927261	5927721	Isn't it funny?
5927761	5933004	You make one little error, miscalculation, and then your life is this.
5936806	5944869	Even though Hammond wasn't bringing much dignity to the situation, this was still quite a moment.
5945550	5951853	Because we were now grand touring on one of the world's most iconic railway lines.
5954005	5960007	It is remarkable that today we can't build a railway line in Britain from London to Manchester.
5961247	5972830	Whereas 150 years ago, someone said, let's build a railway line from Cape Town to Cairo, 7,000 miles across the spine of Africa.
5973930	5975390	And they went, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that.
5976271	5978951	And then someone said, but there's a bloody great gorge in the way.
5978991	5979892	And they said, well, it doesn't matter.
5980672	5981532	Here's what we'll do.
5982389	5988353	build a bridge in Darlington, ship it out there, and we'll assemble it in situ in a good fit.
5988593	5989174	And it did.
5990335	5991215	And here it is.
5997960	5998881	Oh, my God.
6000662	6006426	Driving a Lancia Monte Carlo... on the Victoria Falls Bridge.
6013064	6017454	We are 420 feet above the gorge.
6019177	6020580	Let's just take a moment.
6048221	6050623	I shall certainly miss doing this sort of thing.
6054766	6067335	Having ticked off this unexpected bucket list moment... we trundled along with our minds firmly set on the goal.
6069096	6074400	So, if we can use the railway now to get us past that sort of coal mining area... Yeah.
6076186	6077187	It's a home run, then.
6084652	6095621	I once went on the Orange Express with my wife, Mindy.
6095661	6096942	We had a brilliant time.
6098703	6099404	Very similar.
6112611	6115552	This is more comfortable than the road, isn't it?
6115572	6120334	The other thing as well, for the first time, I've been able to look at the views rather than the road ahead.
6121174	6123835	Yeah, I'm looking at the views as they recede.
6124415	6126696	Can we call you the disorientated express?
6130337	6135358	As we chatted away, I had just one small niggle on my mind.
6136419	6139860	I've been assured that no train is coming in the other direction.
6141957	6143178	But what if one is?
6145479	6150442	It's one of those things you cannot get out of your mind when you're on a single-track railway like this.
6152584	6156006	And then that niggle was joined by another one.
6157767	6160148	Oh, I've got a high-temperature warning here.
6160168	6166112	I don't think my engine is cooling quite like it should be for some reason.
6167553	6170135	Could it be that I've converted my car into a train?
6172372	6176235	My solution was to lift the bonnet and then call on my old friends.
6177395	6178296	Speed and power.
6187302	6189043	Indicated 40 miles an hour.
6190224	6192766	It isn't 40 miles an hour, but that's what it says.
6193987	6195768	Airflow is good now at this speed.
6195848	6196749	Very good.
6201107	6202348	My right leg's going numb now.
6206513	6211698	By mid-afternoon, we were confident we'd actually achieved something.
6215642	6221028	I reckon we've passed the end of the dusty road and all that rough stuff.
6221288	6222009	Yeah, I think we have.
6222089	6223611	We've passed the coal mine for sure.
6225290	6232371	We therefore pulled over at a level crossing to do a job which we'd been avoiding thinking about.
6238172	6239272	How do we get them off?
6239913	6242653	I suppose the approaching freight train could do the job for you.
6243493	6249414	What you need to do first, using the adjustable spanner, because I cannot countenance using an adjustable spanner.
6249514	6250995	Why can't you use one of these?
6251395	6253275	Because it is the tool of a charlatan.
6254215	6255536	You don't mean charlatan, do you?
6255556	6256056	I do, yes.
6256217	6258438	You mean someone who just has one tool instead of 300?
6258858	6260099	And do the lock nuts first.
6260139	6261400	What are you talking about?
6261460	6262400	What's a lock nut?
6262861	6263861	That is a lock nut.
6264121	6265942	This spanner's too big to reach.
6266023	6269084	We don't all have to go to the same old folks' home, do we?
6269705	6269945	No.
6271286	6277129	It's not obligatory after this that we all... He said he's deleting our numbers as soon as we finish.
6277449	6278690	And we've finished delete.
6278850	6279551	There they've gone.
6281752	6282452	It's quite easy to do.
6282492	6283432	They're right next to each other.
6283492	6285313	World's smallest c***, world's biggest c***.
6285333	6286013	We're stalled.
6288074	6289394	That's actually true as well.
6289474	6290234	It's not a lie.
6290414	6290994	It is true.
6293475	6294315	I've had an idea.
6294795	6295255	Oh, Lord.
6295575	6304878	Why don't we go to a screen now that says, 15 minutes later, get the production people to get them off, and then... Looks like we've done it.
6304898	6305778	Looks like we've done it.
6306678	6308218	And then we'll have a line of voiceover.
6308678	6310699	Soon, all the cars were off the railway line.
6314938	6317561	Soon, all the cars were off the railway line.
6321365	6327793	And as the border with Botswana was just under 40 miles away, we had nearly completed our mission.
6330376	6333799	And for that, we had three little heroes to thank.
6337981	6340763	I am amazed that the Ford Capri is still running.
6340984	6341524	I really am.
6342285	6352673	But I'm more amazed by the Stag and the Monte Carlo, because almost anyone who knows anything about cars would say those two are the most unreliable cars ever made.
6353674	6355555	And here they are, soldiering along.
6359378	6362641	And we really did save the best till last.
6374901	6383229	because Zimbabwe has provided the perfect backdrop for our final motoring adventure.
6429968	6447282	Amazing cars.
6447522	6453147	Amazing, amazing cars have survived this amazing, amazing country.
6458351	6462794	Essex.
6462894	6466357	Triumph Stag.
6467078	6476725	Overheating my arse.
6481808	6482829	Well done, Lawrence, here.
6483650	6485951	I can actually see the customs post.
6487068	6488590	You fantastic little car.
6488750	6489531	You've done it.
6490152	6490913	You've done it.
6493075	6497861	Before going up to the checkpoint, we pulled over to reflect on the moment.
6499983	6501124	We have crossed Zimbabwe.
6503171	6503792	And you'd never know.
6503812	6507315	No, barely tell from the... Did you use these cars to do it?
6507335	6507915	Well, quite.
6507935	6510277	I would love to keep this.
6510577	6510778	Yeah.
6511378	6513320	I would probably love to keep it, actually.
6513540	6515221	All we need is three bags to take him home.
6515241	6517703	I mean, this is, I think, restorable.
6518004	6518764	I think mine is.
6518905	6520406	It'd have to completely come apart.
6521166	6526511	Anyway, listen, we must blow up, because obviously we've finished the programme, now we've got to finish the show.
6526531	6527072	The whole thing.
6527732	6528753	So, oh... What?
6534346	6536868	Well, we've got a small problem, haven't we?
6537089	6538069	Well, that's silver.
6539851	6540231	Oh, yeah.
6540471	6541572	We've got to get across the border.
6542753	6543193	The silver?
6543493	6544394	We've got a lot of silver.
6545815	6549198	I mean, if we go through with that smuggling... It is, yes.
6549518	6550119	Shall we remove it?
6550759	6550959	No.
6551239	6554622	No, that would be... Well... Well, you really can't.
6554682	6555963	You'd have no more downforce.
6555983	6556203	Yes.
6557144	6557744	So what do we do?
6558705	6559346	Style it out.
6559546	6560026	Style it out.
6560687	6561107	Relax.
6561187	6562448	Relax is the way.
6562768	6563269	Jobs are good.
6573297	6573618	Hello.
6574758	6575159	Very well.
6575219	6575599	How are you?
6576600	6577881	Do you have anything to declare?
6579682	6579942	No.
6584725	6585806	Can you step outside, please?
6585866	6586286	Yes.
6588748	6589749	He's trying to look normal.
6599349	6600610	dung around the back of his car.
6605493	6606274	Thank you very much.
6606374	6606714	Thank you.
6606734	6607295	Thank you.
6607575	6607835	Thank you.
6607855	6607955	Yes!
6607975	6608035	Yes!
6625509	6633911	I'm just going to play it as, I'm just like a quiet, softly spoken, just a fairly miserable guy.
6633931	6636791	I'm just not, I'm not going to be my bouncy self, because I'll overdo it.
6640892	6641412	Good day, sir.
6641572	6641932	Good day.
6642392	6642712	How are you?
6642953	6643713	Very well, thank you.
6643733	6646113	You have reached the Pandamatinga border post in Tubutwana?
6648174	6652354	You have reached the Pandamatinga border post in Tubutwana?
6652554	6652734	Yes.
6652754	6654735	Do you have anything to declare?
6655115	6655215	No.
6656308	6657788	Can you come and open the boot for us?
6657808	6664050	Please, can you move with us?
6664471	6664731	Yep.
6665191	6666711	Oh, that's not very promising, is it?
6676694	6677515	Thank you very much.
6677535	6678055	You're welcome.
6678095	6678435	Thank you.
6680751	6682953	Enjoy it, Woodsona, and have fun.
6683413	6683714	I will.
6683954	6687117	Thank you.
6688278	6688878	Yeah, OK, I'll go.
6696125	6701149	You'll notice when I open this bonnet, this is the original Stag engine and not the transplanted Rover one.
6712173	6713894	So there are quite a lot of empty drinks tins.
6723941	6724481	All right, sir.
6725021	6726742	You can close the door.
6728223	6728524	Thank you.
6732586	6733887	Oh, shit, the steering wheel's hot.
6734567	6735408	The steering wheel's hot.
6735808	6736789	Don't draw attention to it.
6738970	6739250	Thank you.
6741474	6742195	Knee steer.
6743435	6744176	Knee steer.
6748338	6755363	Ow!
6756704	6760546	Us three smugglers were now on our final drive together.
6760566	6770573	Heading to our favourite place in the world.
6776382	6787368	We've travelled thousands and thousands and thousands of miles and had thousands and thousands and thousands of adventures.
6789930	6792431	We're going to end up right where we started.
6795713	6805178	I never thought that what we do together would go on as it has.
6808700	6810080	I was excited when I got the job.
6810660	6811221	Way back.
6812441	6813281	Very excited.
6814461	6819642	But I never dreamed it would grow into a... a career-and-life-defining adventure.
6819923	6823823	And occasionally, nearly career-and-life-ending adventure.
6828244	6832085	I can't pretend it isn't going to be a wrench, ending this.
6832105	6834526	It exceeds.
6842170	6842710	22 years.
6843770	6845330	More than a third of my life.
6850732	6852932	This is going to hit me in quite small ways.
6853593	6854673	There's a green bag.
6854693	6859254	I have a green hole-all that I've used since the very first special in Botswana.
6859274	6861975	I've always used it for specials, but I've never taken it anywhere else.
6863601	6865482	So what will I do with that green bag?
6865602	6869723	One day I'll come across it in that cupboard where we keep the bags.
6870763	6872104	And I'll think, oh yeah.
6874324	6875425	And it'll come back.
6882487	6888349	Anyway, I hope we've brought you a little bit of happiness.
6895794	6899415	Several miles further on, Hammond broke down again.
6899435	6903716	My car isn't starting.
6905656	6912298	And even though this was our last-ever drive, we felt duty-bound to react in the usual manner.
6912758	6914438	We shall leave you to the walls.
6919439	6923380	And as the tarmac surface was about to stop... Manicalo!
6924500	6929284	I decided to give my feisty little twin cam one last blast.
6929825	6933288	Right, now, finally heading through the bush to the Makati Caddy.
6954523	6955323	Sand roads.
6955423	6956204	I remember those.
6956364	6957924	God, they were so good.
6958945	6959865	So comfortable.
6964807	6965368	The hell?
6975031	6975572	No way.
6982034	6983375	Holy shit!
6991075	6991815	It's my car.
6992736	6994637	It's my car from the very first special.
7001661	7003082	It can't be James's Merc.
7007105	7008265	I don't believe it.
7011227	7012428	The Light Bike Cafe.
7015250	7016610	That is astonishing.
7017151	7020693	I'm slightly choked up.
7025239	7025979	Hang on a minute.
7026859	7027839	The doors were off.
7028000	7028440	No, were they?
7028480	7028820	Yes.
7030020	7034581	Someone's found the doors that we took off to cross the Macaddy Caddy.
7036481	7036901	What's that?
7037441	7039082	You're not going to believe this.
7039382	7041142	You are not going to believe this.
7044623	7045443	Jeez, is it?
7045463	7046543	It's my car.
7048183	7049103	It's my old Lancia.
7050063	7051084	Is that my Mercedes?
7051164	7052564	I think that's your Mercedes.
7053942	7060590	I'll know if this is mine because it'll have the five-speed gear knob on the four-speed box.
7063073	7064174	Christ, it is!
7067198	7070582	I'm absolutely... My heart's just gone kind of nuts.
7071448	7073991	Hey, look, you had the badges gone, which I took as a souvenir.
7074712	7075232	Souvenir?
7075633	7075893	Yes.
7076714	7079517	You know what I've kept as a souvenir on every single special?
7080038	7082060	I've brought... Every single special, I've had it with me.
7082480	7082881	Yes!
7082901	7082961	Yes!
7083441	7084142	Well, give it to me now.
7084463	7084823	Hang on.
7085324	7085864	Where is it?
7086525	7087366	It's in my suitcase.
7087386	7088507	It's always in my suitcase.
7091330	7091851	Sorry, everyone.
7101420	7102361	That was my souvenir.
7103101	7103801	Let's stick it in.
7106603	7107884	I'm sure I took it from here.
7109084	7109504	There you go.
7110105	7111025	It's got its eye back.
7112706	7115128	Somebody found... It must be the same doors.
7115168	7117109	Somebody found those and stuck them back on.
7117149	7117829	We left them.
7117909	7119150	I remember we had to light them.
7119170	7121431	I think we left the doors with that bloke.
7121771	7122532	Noah.
7122572	7123832	Noah the bush mechanic.
7124253	7127334	I wonder if Noah went and recovered the cars and put the doors back on.
7127534	7128255	He probably did.
7147617	7147997	Okay.
7150499	7151100	Incredible.
7166992	7175039	Having spent the night in a luxury camp, we met for breakfast with our minds all focused on the same thing.
7183814	7185115	Have you heard anything from Amazon?
7185535	7186576	Yeah, I've got an email here.
7186796	7187056	Have you?
7189978	7191139	They want their laptops back.
7193801	7199125	So no big fat check, no contract, no letter pleading with us to keep going?
7200046	7200786	No, I've got nothing.
7201787	7203989	Right, well, this really is our last breakfast, then, isn't it?
7204029	7204189	Yeah.
7206030	7206610	This is it.
7208132	7210173	Oh, have you seen this, Hammond?
7211194	7212275	You broke down yesterday.
7213246	7214107	We were driving along.
7218449	7221992	Wait, are those... They're your cars from when we were last here?
7222252	7222772	Seriously?
7222792	7223873	Yeah, just at the side of the road.
7224353	7226234	So they've been here ever since?
7226254	7226635	Yeah.
7226755	7227375	Driving back.
7227935	7229416	Still smell the same Mercedes.
7229656	7234299	And talking of which, we've got the final push today.
7235180	7237101	Short journey to Kublau Island.
7238202	7239122	Across the salt pans.
7240163	7241164	Why don't we do it
7242788	7244069	Makadi-kadi style.
7244089	7266140	This is it.
7267120	7269261	This is how we did it the last time.
7269301	7269802	No doors.
7272270	7274594	What a way to end the Grand Tour!
7275536	7276377	What a place!
7326598	7333279	These mist-covered mountains Are all now for me
7368349	7386804	Someday you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn to be brothers in arms
7402306	7404768	There it is.
7406109	7407670	Coogle Island.
7409271	7410432	Oh, God, I think that's it.
7412514	7412995	That is it.
7420741	7424284	There's our tree.
7426946	7429888	It just remains for me to say
7431501	7434628	Thank you very, very much for watching.
7436452	7436873	Thank you.
7440882	7441423	Means a lot.
7551873	7554785	And, er... That's it.
7580787	7602635	My sweet love Mmm, my lord I really wanna see you Really wanna be with you
7604710	7626384	Really want to see you, Lord, but it takes so long, my love My sweet love My love I really want to see you Really want to see you
7634820	7636532	But it takes so long
7663853	7677820	Are we ready, gentlemen?
7678580	7680101	I... Honestly, I don't know.
7683002	7684202	He's on it!
7686243	7688544	Properly three-legged old man went past.
7690885	7691966	Maybe leaking slightly.
7693530	7694491	What a moron.
7697132	7701614	There must have been 30 or 40 people in the room when the police arrived.
7702035	7702215	Oh!
7702455	7703536	Clarkson!
7707198	7708558	Sideways in, Lennon!
7708578	7712180	Hello.
7716603	7718004	Get out of the way.
7718064	7719464	Get out of the way.
7719524	7720205	I'm in a race.
7723709	7724730	Let's sing a song.
7724790	7725050	No.
7725070	7730015	There's no dignity in that, is there?
7730415	7730776	No.
7734939	7739043	Okay, it's time now, and nobody's ever said this on a car show before.
7740344	7741185	Save the world.
7744188	7747271	We don't all have to go to the same old folks' home, do we?
7747871	7748031	No.
