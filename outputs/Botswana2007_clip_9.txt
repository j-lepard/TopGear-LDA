Look at that sun now, boys.
Elephants, rally special stage, best comb-over I've ever seen.
Everything's here.
We camped by the river, and while James serviced his car, I hatched a plan.
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
Jeremy.
Quick, come here.
Come here.
It's the cow's head.
Yeah, well, it wasn't working in the boat.
I've had a better idea.
What?
Ten.
His ten?
Yeah.
Love your thinking.
What's that?
It was a hippo.
What?
Plugs.
That sounded very close.
Oh, my God, look at that.
Hippos spend all day in water and then they come out at night because... I can't remember why.
Well, thank you.
That's useful.
Thank you.
Oh, brilliant.
Look, do you want to go out there with the hippopotamus?
Or do you want to stay in here where the horse is sat?
That's not a question that's ever been asked.
It's not a horse, either.
It's a cow.
Hang on.
That's my bag in James's tent.
This is my tent!
Oh, man, get it out!
Our starting point at the Zimbabwe border felt like it was in another time zone.
But still, there were many miles of delta to cover, and our cars were in a really bad way.
The bush mechanic we have on the team took two cubic feet of sand out of my carburettor last night and asked if I wouldn't mind driving a bit more slowly today.
James, he's coming!
Our ordinary second-hand road cars were getting more and more out of their depth.
This is proper off-roading now.
Men in camouflage trousers in Wales, who like murdering people at weekends, would say this was tough going.
It was a whole... Oh!
What is it?
It's like iron.
I think I've bent the steering back a bit.
Wow!
Wow, there is an elephant right there.
A door there.
That would stop an elephant.
Soon our route was blocked by a river and what you're supposed to do is wade in to check the depth.
Right.
Jeremy made us drive on until he got bored.
Here, now.
No.
I agree with him, for once, actually, because that reedy stuff must mean it's shallow.
It's shallow where the reeds are, you fool.
We'll just drive over to where the reeds are, then.
Yes, but you've got to drive through the water to get there.
We can't keep going.
We've done 30 miles.
No, I'm frustrated, but you can't just drive into a river because you're bored.
I do a fair bit of off-roading, and I know enough that that's not the place to go across.
You're wrong.
I'm going through here.
Are you going to carry on?
Yeah, well, I will carry on if you're going to go through there.
Keep your radio on.
All right.
I'm going.
I'm not doing a four-by-four.
Okay, so edging.
Fan belts off.
Fan belts off is a good idea.
Cos it'll splash water into the distributors.
James went first and I said I'd watch for crocodiles.
Ooh, I say there's a ground hornbill over there.
It's getting deeper.
Ooh, hang on a minute.
Permission to say cock.
It's coming in!
Thunderbird one to the rescue.
Come on, I'm sinking by the bows.
Coming.
No!
I can't help you.
Come on.
James, I'm in a low, slow sports car.
I'm going down.
That's good.
Yes!
I've got water coming into my car.
I've got a wet bottom!
We're through!
Both our cars were flooded, but our guides weren't bothered at all.
People of Surrey, if this happens to you, you get water in the footwell and you need to drain it out, you're going to need a hole.
Well, the people of Botswana have a tip for you.
Meanwhile...
