Africa absolutely adores, because it's comfortable, it's rugged, it's dependable, and frankly, if the other two have brought anything other than one of these along, they're idiots.
The first idiot arrived.
Can you open the door, because the handle's broken?
It is a Lancia Beta.
Coupe, 1981.
The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of Botswana.
It's done 29,000 miles.
One owner, is it?
A little old lady.
And boy, had she ragged it.
Yeah, that's normal, isn't it?
That fizzing.
That's...
Yeah.
What's the piece of cardboard for?
Is that for mopping up moisture?
No, that's because the battery... Oh, it shorts on the bonnet?
Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
Right.
You've done well.
So now what?
Do you want a lift?
We left the Lancia to cool down because Hammond was arriving.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
