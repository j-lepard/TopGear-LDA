309	5393	Using patience, I'd found a proper crossing point.
5433	9756	There is a technique to fording rivers, even on a proper ford like this.
9816	15640	You've got to keep enough speed up so you push a bow wave like that and you use whatever power you've got in the engine.
15681	17142	Come on, come on, come on.
17602	19083	Oh, my... No!
21645	22265	Oh, God!
24963	26024	He's stalled!
26364	27385	He's going down!
27405	29146	I can't open the door!
29707	43558	Oh, God!
43938	44399	Please!
45079	45640	Come out!
46140	46581	Come on!
46821	47241	Float!
47702	48182	Float!
48822	49303	Float!
50584	50884	Oliver!
54246	55366	Hammond, how's it going?
56567	58408	Well, I got a bit of water in him.
58948	61889	We did as well, but it doesn't matter because we used some rifles.
61929	63850	We shot the cars and the water's all drained out.
63870	64370	It's brilliant.
65691	65911	Good.
68032	69032	I might need the rifle.
71693	75835	As a local tourist truck pulled me out, the laughing hyenas arrived.
80919	83200	May gave his diagnosis.
83601	89544	Starting from the top, the battery's probably pretty knackered, and then the carburettor will be flooded, in a literal sense.
89664	92686	And then working down the distributor cap, that'll be full of water.
93246	97709	The engine itself, I mean, if a bit of water went into the cylinders, you might have compressed it and broken something.
97729	98549	The oil will be ruined.
98569	99290	I know all this.
99450	100330	I can fix him.
100650	102111	You are going to try and mend this?
102371	103652	If you'd leave me to it, yeah.
104212	104893	So we did.
117406	119108	Oh, that's harsh.
119688	120989	That is quite harsh, but go on.
128156	129497	Oh, I like this one.
129857	132579	It's sad, so sad.
133640	136263	It's a sad, sad situation.
139790	143072	Unfortunately, you can only give a man so much sympathy.
143393	145994	So James and I went ahead to make camp.
150377	155961	Hammond knew that in the morning, if his beloved Oliver wasn't fixed, he'd have to leave him behind.
156662	163667	So he got our bush mechanic to bring the generator down... ..and worked on through the night.
175851	178732	Morning came and still no Hammond.
178832	179973	What happened today?
181813	183374	I mean, I'm feeling quite like an explorer.
183434	187495	Is that Hammond?
188536	189976	Is it a beetle more to the point?
194338	194878	No way.
205077	205658	No way.
206218	206699	Oh, yeah.
207259	208100	Yeah, he's back.
213104	213825	And here's the best thing.
213905	215427	Do you remember the horn, which was rubbish?
216147	219090	No, it's excellent.
221712	223054	Is that technically possible?
223274	223794	Probably not.
225356	227518	For 47 years, I've never been speechless.
230953	235510	With all the cars defying all the odds, we began our final push to the border.
238530	241613	My car is working perfectly, as usual.
242334	243214	I've got no brakes.
243415	247698	The pedal goes straight to the floor and I have to declutch to stop, so I just tread on my own foot.
247939	249000	So I'm using the handbrake.
249500	249760	Ha!
249880	251322	The Lancia could beat that.
251742	256867	Every time I brake, it spears off to the right and I'm unable to steer left to correct that.
257247	261151	This has now gone from being a nuisance to being downright dangerous.
262930	267852	We soon reached the end of the Okavango, so we pulled over to remove the animal protection.
268252	269733	And then, guess what?
269753	273114	The Lancia simply would not get going again.
273134	281397	It now won't start, because the starter's only chosen this moment to pack up, but when it was running, it wouldn't move off in any of the gears.
281417	283838	It was just that last 60k.
284139	286179	It had that feel of a car that was dying.
286199	289541	Richard actually sympathised, because he'd been there.
290241	292442	As for James... A vehicle.
295929	297000	I'm not going to give in.
297223	297829	I'll push it.
