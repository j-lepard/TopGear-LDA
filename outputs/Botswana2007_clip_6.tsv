1823	3304	He's protecting the important bits.
6286	9188	Keen to get going, the three of us fired up our engines.
9628	11109	Well, when I say three.
14351	15612	It's absolutely dead.
17033	17913	Nothing is functioning.
17933	22536	There is no electrical... You two are not being helpful.
22676	22936	No.
23497	25058	What a stupid thing to say.
26320	27721	Interior light, headlight?
27921	28241	Nothing.
28541	31242	You don't know how to mend the ignition circuit on a 1981 Lancia Beetle?
31282	34784	No, it's... It was a long shot.
35504	38746	Annoyingly, a couple of the locals did know what to do.
42667	47650	And we drove to African Stig's rally stage, which was in a dried-up riverbed a few miles away.
48810	52872	With packed spectator stands, Oliver went first.
53112	54433	Three, two...
55405	55505	One.
56146	57467	Go!
57948	59069	Three miles an hour.
59610	61792	You know, when it was new, it had 40 horsepower.
62172	65375	If it's lost one a year, it's at minus four.
65616	66757	He's going round the first corner.
66777	67217	Hold on.
70321	71342	That was a power slide.
73083	73764	Look at that.
73864	77288	It does look... Ridiculous is the word you're looking for.
79210	83452	As the cadets struggle to get up the hill, the spectators left.
83532	84113	It is eminent.
84173	85853	Come on, joggle it, Stig's cousin.
86814	87674	He's enjoying that.
88054	90696	And one minute, 12 seconds.
90776	92877	I think that's a good benchmark for you to try and beat.
94198	96179	Next up was the Panzer Tank.
96639	100681	Most powerful, longest, best tyres... Longest?
100961	102422	Longest is good for rallying, is it?
102582	103402	It is on this, yeah.
103682	107064	So why doesn't... On loose surface rallies, don't they turn up with intercity trains?
110871	116333	That's the most ridiculous spectacle I've ever seen in my entire life, a Mercedes with no bonnet, no front wings, no doors.
117574	120315	In the hands of African Stig, though, it was flying.
121275	125397	That is the latest in a long line of pedigree lightened Mercedes-Benz sports cars.
125417	127478	There's never been a Mercedes rally car.
129579	131199	Oh, yours is flying up the hill, mate.
131219	132100	Look at it go.
132980	135641	You wait till you see the Lancia wheel dance through there.
135661	137882	Oh, yeah.
137942	139223	Oh, it's out of control.
141638	142879	That's a big slide!
148181	149002	One minute six.
149442	151683	I'll just do my ancient... I hate you gloating.
151743	152643	No, let him do it.
152983	154644	It's like winning a semi-final.
155245	161507	Time now to put James in his place because the Lancia was on home turf with its rally pedigree.
162088	162768	Stratos, 037.
163048	163268	What?
166590	170511	That's not dust, it's on fire!
170531	173792	Can I turn it off?
173832	178594	Look at it all!
179394	180475	Stopwatch still running.
180495	182135	45 seconds.
183155	184216	We'll replace the seal.
185756	189277	And then, when it's cooled down a bit, he'll be able to do the lap.
189317	190298	He'll have difficulty, though.
190418	190798	He's off.
193550	194490	And maybe he started.
194530	195650	Maybe... Start the stopwatch.
196050	198551	I think he was in a hurry, so he decided not to take your car.
199031	199511	Hey, Jeremy.
199751	199991	What?
200011	200431	You're right, though.
200451	200891	Your engine.
201351	201912	It's canted.
205752	208373	Once again, the broken lance here was fixed.
208773	211753	And then Jeremy arrived with some woe for all of us.
212794	213014	What?
215294	215914	Forget some of it.
215934	217274	That's it.
219895	220895	Those are the fuel cans.
221365	227374	The problem was that Richard's car and mine ran on leaded fuel, which was incredibly hard to find.
228356	231461	And it was no use turning to the film crew for help.
231821	234145	Diesel, diesel, diesel and two-stroke.
234185	236669	Diesel... Guys, it's diesel and two-stroke.
240000	246542	The town of Maun was about 60 miles away, and with little fuel, we'd have to go there as the crow flies.
247222	249723	Now we really would see how they'd cope off-road.
250123	254864	We've got to try and keep the distance down to save what fuel we've got.
255484	261586	All we're looking for is a track indicating that other people have passed this way and they would be heading to a town.
263786	265247	That's how broken my car is.
265347	266327	I was doing that in park.
272634	274435	These thorns are incredible.
275155	275955	Oh, look at that.
275975	278056	They've got like cocktail sticks growing out of them.
278496	280016	Take cover.
284357	287998	Once again, the 44-year-old Opel absolutely shone.
288618	291379	Come on, little fella.
292039	292660	Yeah!
293400	297721	With our precious fuel burning away, we carved out the straightest path possible.
