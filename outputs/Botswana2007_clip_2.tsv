3154	5855	We drove deeper and deeper into the bush.
8937	9597	Lancia!
10137	10857	Yeah!
13339	14179	What is that?
14199	18061	Looks like the sea.
20642	23203	Eventually, the road disappeared altogether.
28465	30846	People of Surrey, I hope you're watching this.
31447	31827	We are...
34008	40592	driving a Lancia Beta Coupe, well, just in the middle of the... whatever you call this.
45955	49417	The good news was we'd successfully reached our campsite for the night.
49997	53139	The bad news came in the shape of another challenge.
53899	56361	Stretching before you is the Mercati Caddy.
59400	61401	These are the biggest salt flats in the world.
61421	65564	They're almost completely lifeless and as wide as Portugal.
66084	68306	No car has ever driven across them.
69136	71317	If you run out of water, you will die.
71337	75098	If your car breaks down and you can't be rescued, you will die.
75538	77739	If you run out of food, you will die.
78199	79980	It's like driving on a creme brulee.
80000	83801	There's a primeval ooze covered with a thin layer of salty crust.
84421	89283	If you have thin tyres, you will break through that crust, get stuck and you will die.
90043	95545	So it advises to fit fat tyres and remove as much weight as possible before setting off.
96903	97824	Well, how hard can it be?
98164	99085	Don't say that!
101306	103487	In camp, the weight-shedding began.
103508	104268	Ready?
107450	108191	That doesn't work.
113354	115235	Thanks awfully.
115275	116696	Feel how much this seat weighs.
118337	118938	Right, you work.
129640	131520	Fuel filler, I'll need that, maybe.
133281	137642	I'm going to take the hubcaps off, really, because they protect the hubs.
140202	141142	Can I point something out?
141262	141443	What?
141963	145043	Hammond's walking around his car muttering about how he needs all of it.
145063	147504	I know exactly what he's doing.
148024	149804	He's formed an emotional attachment, hasn't he?
149824	152605	It would be like saying to him, could you cut bits off your wife?
155097	155597	What are you doing?
156058	159340	I'm just going to take the radiator grill off on the basis that it's just an ornament.
159521	160061	Can I help you?
160441	160822	Please do.
161122	161862	Do you want your windows there?
161883	162783	No, no, no, no, they're fine.
162823	164585	No, really, I've worked that out.
164605	164865	Glasses?
164885	166566	This is the old glass.
166666	167547	Very thin glass.
168928	169389	Very thin.
172851	174032	God, they come off easily.
175554	175874	James?
176194	176494	Yes?
176654	177956	Using nothing but a hammer?
178256	178596	Yes.
179997	183740	Here's your beer.
184141	184481	Thank you, mate.
185677	186697	Have we lost enough weight now?
186998	189098	You haven't lost an ounce.
189118	191219	I've lost the spare wheel and something else.
191319	192040	Now look at mine.
192580	195581	I'm going to need some guide ropes to stop it floating away like a big balloon.
199703	200703	So tomorrow we die then?
201224	203425	No, I think it's like all these things, it's exaggerated.
203785	204705	We'll be fine, honestly.
204945	205645	We're going to be fine.
205986	206566	We've done enough.
216957	225282	The next morning, on the edge of the salt pans, we thought we'd come under attack from a Bond villain, but it turned out to be the vice-president of Botswana.
228665	230486	That is a killer ride.
230606	234188	It's better than an official Rover 75 and a couple of policemen on motorbikes.
235269	237790	He was amazed to hear what was being planned.
238391	243014	I've just never known anybody to go across in a car.
243054	244575	This should be the first time, I think.
247034	247374	Oh, really?
247694	248835	Oh, really?
249075	249375	Yes.
250075	251055	That should be interesting.
251735	253216	You were smiling, you've just stopped.
255217	266280	Buoyed by the Vice President's optimism, we set off.
266360	269361	Nothing really prepares you for the sheer size of these.
274039	276920	I think, in a way, that is more frightening than the pole.
277461	282383	It's absolutely... You can see the curvature of the earth.
283083	286305	As we ploughed on, the little Opel was going well.
286905	288146	Oliver is just skipping.
288586	288806	Boom!
289846	291447	This car was born to do this.
292788	297350	Sadly, though, despite the weight-shedding, my Lancia was not doing so well.
298230	299931	Judging by the way the tyres are kind of turning,
